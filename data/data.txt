April is the fourth month of the year .
It has 30 days .
The name April comes from that Latin word aperire which means `` to open '' .
This probably refers to growing plants in spring .
April begins on the same day of week as July in all years and also January in leap years .
April 's flower is the Sweet Pea .
Its birthstone is the diamond .
The meaning of the diamond is innocence .
Poets use April to mean the end of winter .
For example : April showers bring May flowers .
August is the eighth month of the year .
It has 31 days .
This month was first called Sextilis in Latin , because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar .
The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus .
It was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC .
Or , when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC -LRB- Roman writers disagree -RRB- .
August is named for Augustus Caesar .
The month has 31 days because the Roman senate wanted as many days as Julius Caesar 's month July .
August is in summer , after July and before September .
An extra day was moved from February in order to make the month of August seem more important .
February gets its day back when the leap year adjustment is made .
August 's flower is the Gladiolus with the birthstone being peridot .
The word art is used to describe some activities or creations of human beings that have importance to the human mind , regarding an attraction to the human senses .
Therefore , art is made when a human expresses himself or herself .
Some art is useful in a practical sense , such as a sculptured clay bowl that one can put things in .
Many people disagree on how to define art .
Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity .
Art includes drawing , painting , sculpting , photography , performance art , dance , music , poetry , prose and theater .
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit .
An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people , the amount of people who can relate to it , and how much people appreciate it .
The first and broadest sense of `` art '' means `` arrangement '' or `` to arrange . ''
In this sense , art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form ; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design .
Art can also be a form of expression of emotion .
The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them .
Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience .
Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well , then the art work will become publicly successful .
All of the great ancient civilizations , such as Ancient Egypt , India , China , Greece , Rome or Arabia had works and styles of art .
In the Middle Ages , most of the art in Europe showed Biblical stories in paintings , stained glass windows , and mosaic tile floors and walls .
Islamic art includes geometric patterns , Islamic calligraphy , and architecture .
In India and Tibet , painted sculptures , dance , and religious painting were done .
In China , arts included jade carving , bronzework , pottery , poetry , calligraphy , music , painting , drama , and fiction .
There are many Chinese artistic styles , which are usually named after the ruling dynasty .
In Europe , after the Middle Ages , -LRB- which some people call the Mediaeval Period or the `` Dark Ages '' -RRB- there was a `` Renaissance '' which means `` rebirth '' .
People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects .
People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures , but they also now could paint mythological pictures too .
These artists also invented linear perspective where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture .
This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other .
In the late 1800s , artists in Europe , responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism , Romanticism , Realism , and Impressionism .
The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism , Fauvism , Cubism , Dadaism , and Surrealism , and Minimalism .
In some societies , people think that art belongs to the person who made it , such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art .
They think that the artist put his or her `` talent '' into the art .
In this view , the art is the property of the artist .
In other societies , people think that art belongs to no one .
They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist 's work .
In this view , society is a collective that has made the art , through the artist .
Works of art let us know about what the author knew , and about what the surrounding of the author were like .
Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure , a sensation of beauty .
Some artists draw what they see the future like , and some of them are right ...
Art makes us think about it , not about reality ; we have a rest .
What did the artist value ?
What aims did he like\/dislike in human activity ?
This usually is clearly seen in artists ' works .
What message , criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve ?
Art that is sometimes very confusing .
It may provoke feelings of anger in the individual at how a black box can sell for so much money .
Michaels .
Painting is the art of applying the brush to paper with materials on it .
Street is an expression of the culture of urban youth , very often the blacks .

Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities .
Autonomous means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power , its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power .
These are similar , but NOT the same , to states in the United States of America , for example .
Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces .
In 1978 these parts came together , making the autonomous communities .
Before then , some of these provinces were together but were broken .
The groups that were together once before are called `` historic communities '' : Catalonia , Basque Country , Galicia and Andalusia .
Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa : Ceuta and Melilla .
They are called `` autonomous cities '' and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities .
Alan Mathison Turing -LRB- June 23 , 1912 - June 7 , 1954 -RRB- was an English mathematician and computer scientist .
He was one of the first people to work with modern digital computers .
He was the first person to think of using a computer for different things .
He told people that computers could run different programs .
Turing introduced the idea of a Turing machine in 1936 .
The machine was imaginary , and ran a set of commands .
Turing also thought of the Turing test .
The Turing test is a test to see if a person can tell the difference between another person and a computer .
During the Second World War , Turing was a main participant in the efforts to break German ciphers .
On the basis of cryptanalysis he helped to break both the Enigma machine and the Lorenz SZ 40\/42 -LRB- a teletype cipher attachment codenamed `` Tunny '' by the British -RRB- , and was , for a time , head of Hut 8 , the section responsible for reading German naval signals .
Alan Turing was a gay man .
In 1952 , Turing admitted having sex with a man .
At that time in England , homosexuality was a crime .
He was tried and convicted of this crime in a British court .
and was forced to make a choice .
He had to choose between going to jail or `` chemical castration '' -LRB- taking female hormones like estrogen to lower his sex drive -RRB- .
He chose the hormones .
But this made him impotent -LRB- unable to have sex -RRB- and made him grow breasts .
After suffering these effects for two years , he committed suicide -LRB- killed himself -RRB- with an apple poisoned with cyanide in 1954 .
The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong , going against medical ethics and international laws of human rights , and malpractice by most doctors .
Alanis Nadine Morissette -LRB- born June 1 , 1974 -RRB- is a Grammy Award-winning Canadian-American singer and songwriter .
She was born in Ottawa , Canada .
She began singing in Canada as a teenager in 1990 .
In 1995 , she became popular all over the world .
As a young child in Canada , Morissette began to act on television , including 5 episodes of the long-running series , You Ca n't Do That on Television .
Her first album was released only in Canada in 1990 .
She also acted in several movies , including Kevin Smith 's Dogma , where she played God .
Alanis Morissette 's father is French-Canadian .
Her mother is from Hungary .
She has an older brother , Chad , and a twin brother who is 12 minutes younger than she is .
Her parents had worked as teachers at a military base in Lahr , Germany .
Morissette has had many albums .
Her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill became a very popular album .
It has sold over 30 million copies worldwide .
The album caused Morissette to win four Grammy Awards .
The album Jagged Little Pill touched many people .
On the album , Morissette sang songs about many different things .
These things include :
Morissette has written many songs .
Some of her most famous songs are :
Adobe Illustrator is a computer program for making graphic design and illustrations .
It is made by Adobe Systems .
Pictures created in Adobe Illustrator can be made bigger or smaller , and look exactly the same at any size .
It works well with the rest of the products with the Adobe name .
It was first released in 1986 for the Apple Macintosh .

Andouille is a type of pork sausage .
It is spicy -LRB- hot in taste -RRB- and smoked .
There are different kinds , all with different combinations of pork meat , fat , intestines -LRB- tubes going to the stomach -RRB- , and tripe -LRB- the wall of the stomach -RRB- .
Andouille sausage first came from France or Germany -LRB- no-one is sure -RRB- , but the name indicates that it may have come out from France , and the most famous sort in the USA is the `` Cajun '' style .
Other sorts are `` French andouille '' and `` German andouille '' ; they are less spicy than Cajun .
Cajun has extra salt , black pepper , and garlic .
Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours , at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 80 degrees Celsius -RRB- .
Arithmetic is what we call working with numbers .
It is a part of mathematics .
The four basic arithmetic operations are addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division .
Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers , fractions , and decimals , and taking powers and roots .
Most people learn arithmetic in grade school , but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned .
Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic , and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic .
A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters , plumbers , auto mechanics , accountants , architects , doctors , and nurses .
Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics , science , and engineering .
A Calculator can be used to do arithmetic .
Addition is the mathematical way of putting things together .
In arithmetic , addition is finding the total of two or more numbers .
The sign for addition is '' + '' .
The name for the sign '' + '' is `` plus '' .
For example , there are objects in two groups .
The objects are small circles : `` o '' .
One group has five of these objects .
The other group has 3 of these objects .
To find the total number of objects in both groups , the objects can be counted .
Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group .
Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B , since they are already counted .
In symbols :
There are rules for adding numbers that people learn .
There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines .
The rule says that :
In another counting example , Sally and Bill have 2 children .
Sally and Bill get 3 more children .
Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children .
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally 's house .
Bob 's house is 300 meters east of Tom 's house .
Sally 's house is 120 meters east of Bob 's house :
The distance from Tom 's house to Sally 's house can be found by adding the distances already measured .
The distance from Tom 's house to Bob 's house added to the distance from Bob 's house to Sally 's house is the same as the distance from Tom 's house to Sally 's house .
That is , three hundred -LRB- 300 -RRB- meters plus 120 meters .
Addition can also mean to make bigger .
Australia is a country in the Southern Hemisphere between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean .
Its official name is the Commonwealth of Australia .
Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass .
22 million people live in Australia .
About 60 % live in and around the mainland state capitals of Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth and Adelaide .
Australia 's capital city is Canberra .
Australia , New Zealand , New Guinea and and other islands on the Australian tectonic plate are together called Australasia .
They form one of the world 's great ecozones .
When other Pacific islands are included , the term is Oceania .
Australia 's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the Indo-Australian plate .
The continent of Australia , including the island of Tasmania , was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago .
Because of this , many animals and plants live in Australia that are not found anywhere else .
These include animals like the kangaroo , the koala , the emu , the kookaburra , and the platypus .
People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago .
These native Australians are called the Australian Aborigines .
For the history of Australia , see History of Australia .
Most of the Australian colonies , having been settled from Britain , became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901 .
The first Prime Minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901 .
Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations .
It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a Governor General who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia .
Australia has six states , two major mainland territories , and other minor territories .
The states are New South Wales , Queensland , South Australia , Tasmania , Victoria , and Western Australia .
The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory -LRB- ACT -RRB- .
In July 2007 Australia had just over 21 million people .
Most Australians live in cities along the coast , such as Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , Darwin , Hobart and Adelaide .
The largest inland city is Canberra , which is also the nation 's capital .
The largest city is Sydney .
Although Australia is a very big country , a lot of the land is very dry .
The middle of the continent is mostly desert .
Only the areas around the east , west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate -LRB- not too hot -RRB- for many farms and cities .
The Australian Aboriginal people arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago .
Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788 , the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land .
They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways .
An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now .
Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees .
This meant that a lot of grass grew back , but not many big trees .
Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains , but not in forests .
The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people .
Sometimes , Aborigines would name a person after an animal , and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population .
Aboriginal people did not usually build houses , except huts of grass , leaves and bark .
They did not usually build walls or fences , and there were no horses , cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens .
The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river , and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania .
The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth .
In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads , but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood .
Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making .
The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting .
The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them .
They believed that they had grown from the land , so it was like their mother , and they belonged to the land .
In the 1600s , Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia -LRB- now Indonesia -RRB- , to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia .
The Dutch Governor , van Diemen , sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania , which he named Van Diemen 's Land .
Its name was later changed to honor the man who discovered it .
The British Government were sure that there must be a very large land in the south , that had not been explored .
They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean .
His ship , HMS Endeavour , carried the famous scientists , Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun .
Captain Cook 's secret mission was to find `` Terra Australis '' -LRB- the Land of the South -RRB- .
The voyage of discovery was very successful , because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it .
Then they sailed westward .
At last , a boy , William Hicks , who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon .
Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks .
They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw `` New South Wales '' .
At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food .
Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were .
They collect hundreds of plants to take back to England .
Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life .
He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit .
But there were no houses and no fences .
In most parts of the world , people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land .
But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way .
They belonged to the land , like a baby belongs to its mother .
Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no-one owned the land .
This was to cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people .
In the 1700s , in England , laws were tough , many people were poor and gaols were full .
A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread .
Many people were hanged for small crimes .
But usually they were just thrown in gaol .
Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America .
But in the 1770 's , the colonies in America became the United States .
They were free from British rule and would not take England 's convicts any more .
By the 1780s the gaols -LRB- jails -RRB- of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships .
The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there .
In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts , sailors , marines , a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years .
Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip .
They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered , named Botany Bay , because of the plants found there by the two scientists .
Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy .
There was not much fresh water .
He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was `` the finest harbor in the world ! ''
There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on .
On the 26th January , 1788 , the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England , and the new settlement was called Sydney .
For the first few years of the settlement , things were very difficult .
No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony .
Nobody had chosen them carefully .
There was only one man who was a farmer .
There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder , a brickmaker or a blacksmith .
No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke .
The cattle all escaped .
There were no cooking pots .
All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten .
There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation .
Somehow , the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor , Arthur Phillip , and another hut for the supply of food , grew into a small town with streets , a bridge over the stream , a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships .
By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor .
There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today .
Settlements had spread out from Sydney , firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen 's Land -LRB- Tasmania -RRB- , and also up the coast to Newcastle , where coal was discovered , and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd .
Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney , and by 1820 , farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England .
While the settlement was growing in New South Wales , it was also growing in Tasmania .
The climate in Tasmania was more like that of in England , and farmers found it easy to grow crops there .
Because Australia is such a very large land , it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people .
In the early days of the colony , a great number of explorers went out , searching for good land to settle on .
When the settlers looked west from Sydney , they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains .
They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them .
In 1813 Gregory Blaxland , William Lawson and a 17 year-old called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming .
A road was built and the Governor , Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side , 100 miles from Sydney .
Some people , like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it .
Many of the explorers did not prepare very well , or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year .
Some died like Burke and Wills .
Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice .
The second time , he was never seen again .
Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers .
He mapped the country as he went , and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years .
He traveled all the way to what is now western Victoria , and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there .
The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania , had built themselves a house , had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine .
The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold .
The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry .
By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people , very rich .
Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came .
The people in Australia wanted to run their own country , and not be told what to do from London .
The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London .
Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy .
William Wentworth started the Australian Patriotic Association -LRB- Australia 's first political party -RRB- in 1835 to demand democratic government .
In 1840 , the some city councils started and some people could vot .
New South Wales Legislative Council had its first elections in 1843 , again with some limits on who could vote .
In 1855 , limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania .
In 1855 , the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia .
The other colonies soon followed .
Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections .
Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent .
But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament .
Until 1901 , Australia was not a nation , it was six separate colonies governed by Britain .
They voted to join together to form one new country , called the Commonwealth of Australia , in 1901 .
Australia was still part of the British Empire , and for at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia .
But soon it had its own money , and its own Army and Navy .
In Australia at this time , the trade unions were very strong , and they started a political party , the Australian Labor Party .
Australia passed many laws to help the workers
In 1914 , the First World War started in Europe .
Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany , Austria-Hungary and Turkey .
Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli , in Turkey .
They fought bravely , but were beaten by the Turks .
Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day .
They also fought on the Western Front .
More than 60,000 Australians were killed .
Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 .
But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore by Japan .
Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion .
But with help from the United States Navy , the Japanese were stopped .
After the war , Australia became a close friend of the United States .
When the war ended , Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work .
So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war .
It did things like build the Snowy Mountains Scheme .
Over the next 25 years , millions of people came to Australia .
They came from espcially from Italy and Greece , other countries in Europe .
Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon .
An important new party , the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972 , then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party .
Whitlam made changes , but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor-General sacked him and forced an election in 1975 .
Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party .
In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from China , Vietnam , Malaysia and other countries in Asia .
Australian became more multicultural .
In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world , helped by mining and wool .
Australia started trading more with America , then Japan .
Australia supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq .
Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like East Timor in 1999 .
In 1973 , the famous Sydney Opera House opened .
In the 1970s , 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies , actors and singers became famous around the world .
In the year 2000 , Sydney had the Summer Olympics .
In the 1980s and 90s , the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating , then the Liberal Party under John Howard made lots of changes to the economy .
Australia had a bad recession in 1991 , but but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008 , Australia stayed strong .
Today Australia is a rich , peaceful and democratic country .
But it still has problems .
Around 4-5 % of Australians could not get a job in 2010 .
A lot of land in Australia -LRB- like Uluru -RRB- has been returned to Aboriginal people , but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else .
Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia .
These people may come because they want to do business , or to live in a democracy , to join their family , or because they are refugees .
Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two , including around 660,000 refugees .
Julia Gillard became the first woman Prime Minister of Australia in 2010 when she replaced her colleague Kevin Rudd of the Labor Party .
Australia is made up of six states and two mainland territories .
Each of state and territory has its own Parliament and makes its own local laws .
The Australian Parliament sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country , also known as the Commonwealth or Federation .
The Federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Australia , who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader .
The current Prime Minister is Julia Gillard , who replaced Kevin Rudd , elected in June 2010 .
She is the leader of a political party called the Australian Labor Party .
The other main party is the Liberal Party
The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister , although the Governor-General represents the Queen of Australia , who is also the Queen of Great Britain , as head of state .
The Governor-General , currently , Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce , is chosen by the Prime Minister .
Australia was colonised by people from Britain , but today people from all over the world live there .
English in the main spoken language , and Christianity is the main religion though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion .
Australia is multicultural , which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages , religions and ways of life , while also learning English and joining in with other Australians .
Famous Australian writers include the bush balladeers Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson who wrote about life in the Australian bush .
More modern famous writers include Peter Carey , Thomas Keneally and Colleen McCullough .
In 1973 , Patrick White won the Nobel Prize in Literature , the only Australian to have achieved this ; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century .
Australian music has had lots of world-wide stars from the opera singers Nellie Melba and Joan Sutherland , to the rock and roll bands Bee Gees , AC\/DC and INXS , the folk-rocker Paul Kelly , the pop singer Kylie Minogue and Australian country music stars Slim Dusty and John Williamson .
Australian Aboriginal music is very special and very ancient : it has the famous digeridoo woodwind instrument .
Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including Skippy the Bush Kangaroo , Home and Away and Neighbours - and produced such well known TV stars as Barry Humphries -LRB- Dame Edna Everage -RRB- , Steve Irwin -LRB- The Crocodile Hunter -RRB- and The Wiggles .
Australia has two public broadcasters -LRB- the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS -RRB- , three commercial television networks , three pay TV services , and numerous public , non-profit television and radio stations .
Each major city has daily newspapers , and there are two national daily newspapers , The Australian and The Australian Financial Review .
Australian movies have a very long history .
The world 's first feature-film was the Australian movie The Story of the Kelly Gang of 1906 .
In 1933 , In the Wake of the Bounty , directed by Charles Chauvel , had Errol Flynn as the main actor .
Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood .
The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942 's Kokoda Front Line !
, directed by Ken G. Hall .
In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with films like Picnic at Hanging Rock , Gallipoli -LRB- with Mel Gibson -RRB- , The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee .
Russell Crowe , Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger became global stars during the 1990s and Australia starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman made a lot of money in 2008 .
Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities .
23.5 % Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities .
In international sports , Australia has very strong teams in cricket , hockey , netball , rugby league , rugby union , and performs well in cycling , rowing and swimming .
Local popular sports include Australian rules football , horse racing , soccer and motor racing .
Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games since 1896 , and every Commonwealth Games .
Australia has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics , and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000 .
Australia has also hosted the 1938 , 1962 , 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games .
Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open , one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments , annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix .
Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia .

Australian Rules Football is also popular .
The main sporting leagues for males are AFL , NRL , A-League and NBL .
For women , they are ANZ Netball Championships , W-League and WNBL .
The famous sports players who are Australian include the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman , the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the athlete Cathy Freeman .
Just 50 years ago , Australia had only one big Art festival .
Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals , and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms .
American English or U.S. English is the dialect of English language spoken in the United States .
It is different in some ways from other variations of English , such as British English .
Historically , many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England .
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken .
This is partly because people hear and read American English via the media , for example CNN television , and the Internet , where the most common form of English is American English .
Because people all over the world hear and read American English as well as other versions of English we may find that the English language starts to take on -LRB- acquire -RRB- new words .
English has been changing for centuries , adding new words to its vocabulary .
For example , the English language spoken in India , which has more than one billion people , will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from from any of the 200 + Indian languages .
Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America - for example , in telephone call centers in India and other places , people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America .
These people often continue to use American English in everyday life .
Many word definitions are different in American English .
Most changes in a language start with small things like this - for instance Italian , Spanish , French all came from Latin due to many small changes in use over centuries .
There are many words that sound the same between the American English and British English , but are spelled differently .
For example :
There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English , e.g. :
Aquaculture is the farming of fish , shrimp , and algae .
Aquaculture supplies fish -LRB- such as catfish , salmon , and trout , shrimp , and algae -RRB- .
Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies for over 20 % of all the seafood harvested .
However aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in the 1879 .
An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase .
People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot .
The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way , but some abbreviations do not use this mark .
More often , they use periods , especially the ones that come from the Latin language .
Common Latin abbreviations include i.e. -LRB- id est -RRB- that is , e.g. -LRB- exempli gratia -RRB- for example , and et al . -LRB- et alia -RRB- and others .
Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists , by workers in companies and governments , and by people using the Internet .
People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms .
Here are examples of common acronyms : The word `` radar '' is an acronym for `` Radio Detection and Ranging '' .
The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words `` International Business Machines '' .
The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA , from the words `` National Aeronautics and Space Administration '' .
When people using the Internet think that something is very funny , they sometimes write `` LOL '' to mean `` Laughing Out Loud '' .
People sometimes write `` ASAP '' for `` As Soon As Possible '' .
In many religions , an angel is a good spirit .
In the Old Testament , the New Testament , and the Qur ` an angels appear frequently as the messengers of God .
In all of these , angels appear like humans .
They usually have wings like a bird .
In Christianity angels are helpers of god who are ministers to the faithful .
Angels do not have the ability to sin .
The word angel comes from the Greek word angelos which means `` messenger '' .
In the Bible angels often punished peoples for their sins .
They tested people 's faith in God .
Angels in the Bible are usually pictured with wings and a halo .
The wings represent their speed , and the halo represents their holiness .
Few angels are named in the Bible apart from Michael and Gabriel .
Ad hominem is a Latin term .
It is used in rhetoric .
Rhetoric is the science of how to speak well , and how to convince other people of your ideas .
Translated to English , ad hominem means against the person -LRB- Latin homo , where hominem is a form is gender-neutral .
In ancient Rome it referred to all free men , and by extension to all free human beings -RRB- .
The term is used to describe a rhetorical argument , that is directed towards the person who says something , not about the cause at hand .
It is a way to use reputation and rumor and hearsay to change minds .
When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person , or applied a label to them , this works more often .
Because it works and is also unfair to everyone who would benefit from what they say , it is considered to be a weak or poor argument .
Formal disapproval of those who use it is common in a court or in diplomacy , where danger is high .
In logic , a proof is something that starts with premises , and goes through a few logical arguments , to reach a conclusion .
In this example it can be seen that the -LRB- completely unrelated -RRB- fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal .
The apple is a pomaceous fruit from the apple tree .
It is in the species Malus domestica in the rose family Rosaceae .
One could espouse the notion , perhaps , that the apple is one of most cultivated of tree fruits , and one would of course find one 's side supported by a rather weighty body of scientific evidence .
The tree came from Central Asia .
Its wild ancestor is still there today .
There are more than 7,500 kinds of different apple trees .
At least 55 million tons of apples were grown around in the world in 2005 .
All together , they cost about $ 10 billion .
China produced about 35 % of the world 's apples .
The United States produces more than 7.5 % of the apples around the world .
This makes it the second greatest producer .
Iran is third , after which comes Turkey , Russia , Italy and India .
The apple has a small , deciduous tree that grows up to 3 t tall .
The apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs .
The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals .
They are 5 to 12 cm long and 3 - wide .
It has a sharp top with a soft underside .
Blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud .
The flowers are white .
They also have a slightly pink color .
They are five petaled , and 2.5 t in diameter .
The fruit matures in autumn .
It is usually 5 t diameter .
There are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit .
Every carpel has one to three seeds .
The wild ancestors of Malus domestica are Malus sieversii .
They grow wild in the mountains of Central Asia in the south of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Xinjiang , China , and possibly also Malus sylvestris .
Unlike domesticated apples , their leaves become red in autumn .
They are being used recently to develop Malus domestica to grow in colder climates .
The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated .
Its fruits have become better over thousands of years .
It is said that Alexander the Great discovered dwarfed apples in Asia Minor in 300 BCE .
Asia and Europe have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years .
From when Europeans arrived , Argentina and the United States have used apples as food as well .
Apples were brought to North America in the 1600s .
The first apple orchard on the North American continent was said to be near Boston in 1625 .
In the 1900s , costly fruit industries , where the apple was a very important species , began developing .
In Norse mythology , the goddess IÃ unn gives apples to the gods in Prose Edda -LRB- written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson -RRB- that makes them young forever .
English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to religious practices in Germanic paganism .
It was from there , she claims , that Norse paganism developed .
She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg ship in Norway .
She also remarks that fruit and nuts -LRB- IÃ unn having been described as changing into a nut in SkÃ ldskaparmÃ l -RRB- have been discovered in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England .
They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe .
She suggests that this may have had a symbolic meaning .
Nuts are still a symbol of fertility in Southwest England .
Sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked .
Often apples are eaten uncooked .
Apples can also be made into drinks .
Apple juice and apple cider are apple drinks .
The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet .
Apples used for cooking are sour , and need to be cooked with sugar , while other apples are sweet , and do not need cooking .
There are some seeds at the core , that can be removed with a tool that removes the core , or by carefully using a knife .
The scientific name of the apple tree genus in the Latin language is Malus .
Most apples that people grow are of the Malus domestica species .
Most apples are good to eat raw -LRB- not cooked -RRB- , and are also used in many kinds of baked foods , such as apple pie .
Apples are cooked until they are soft to make apple sauce .
Apples are also made into the drinks apple juice and cider .
Usually , cider contains a little alcohol , about as much as beer .
The regions of Brittany in France and Cornwall in England are known for their apple ciders .
If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type .
The seed will have DNA from the apple that the seeds came from , but it will also have DNA from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds , which may well be a different type .
This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two .
In order to grow a certain type of apple , a small twig , or ` scion ' , is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired , and then added on to a specially grown stump called a rootstock .
The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed .
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples .
Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates .
One large collection of over 2,100 apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in England .
Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh -LRB- dessert apples -RRB- .
However , some are grown simply for cooking or making cider .
Cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately .
However , they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples can not .
Most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp .
Colorful skin , easy shipping , disease resistance , ` Red Delicious ' apple shape , and popular flavor are also needed .
Modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars .
This is because popular tastes in apples have become different .
Most North Americans and Europeans enjoy sweet apples .
Extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in Asia and India .
In the United Kingdom there are about 3000 different types of apples .
The most common apple type grown in England is the ` Bramley seedling ' , which is a popular cooking apple .
Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s , when apples were rarely brought in from other countries .
Organizations such as Common Ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit .
` Apple Day ' is celebrated each October 21 in many countries .
Many apples are grown in temperate parts of the United States and Canada .
In many areas where apple growing is important , people have huge celebrations :
Apples are in the group Maloideae .
It is a subfamily of the family Rosaceae .
They are in the same subfamily as pears .
Its family is the family of rose like plants , and roses are in the family .
Algebra is a part of mathematics -LRB- frequently just called math or maths -RRB- .
It is used to find values and variables that make equations and inequalities true .
It often needs knowledge of the rules of numbers and mathematics operations used on numbers -LRB- adding , subtracting , multiplying , dividing , and other operations -RRB- .
Algebra uses letters -LRB- a , b , c , ... -RRB- and other symbols to represent numbers .
The letters and symbols in algebra are called variables .
We use variables because the numbers are unknown or can change .
Algebra was first used to solve equations .
Two examples are linear equations and quadratic equations .
The ways developed to solve equations frequently made use of the facts of the parts of an equation .
For example , how to factorize polynomials , or how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once .
Abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations .
For example , polynomials and matrices .
These things are known as algebraic structures .
Understanding the properties of more complex algebraic structures can help us solve more complex equations .
Of particular importance to the study of algebra is the study of functions , since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve .
A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out .
When a function takes one variable in , like f -LRB- x -RRB- , it is called a univariate function .
When a function takes many variables in , like Q -LRB- x , y , z -RRB- , it is called a multivariate function .
The study of algebra is heavily concerned with the subject of graphing functions , as graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations .
In some math problems one variable is changed .
The variable that is changed is called the `` independent '' variable .
After the variable is changed the math operations in the equation are performed to make a number .
The number that is made is called the `` dependent '' variable .
Most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y , for example , in y = 3x + 1 .
This is because we do not know what number they are until we are told .
Many math problems are about physics .
In many of these physics problems time is a variable .
Time is written t. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems .
Algebra is taught in school to help in harder mathematics , science , and engineering classes .
Sue has 12 jellybeans , Ann has 24 jellybeans .
They decide to share so that they have the same number of jellybeans .
Let x represent the number of jellybeans Ann gives to Sue .
Then we want 12 + x = 24 - x.
This problem could be solved without algebra .
The purpose of simple story problems such as this one is to teach algebra .
Once a student is comfortable with simple problems like this , it is easier to try harder ones .
With practice , the students can use algebra when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way .
Problems such as building a freeway , designing a cell phone , or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra .
In addition to `` elementary algebra '' , or basic algebra , there are advanced forms of algebra , taught in colleges and universities , such as abstract algebra , linear algebra , and universal algebra .
With abstract algebra and universal algebra , it is hard to see how studying them helps solve problems , but with linear algebra it is much clearer .
Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things .
In algebra , adding z to y -LRB- or y plus z -RRB- is written as y + z. Subtracting z from y -LRB- or y minus z -RRB- is written as y â ' z.
In algebra , multiplying y by z -LRB- or y times z -RRB- can be written in 4 ways : y Ã -- z , y \* z , yÂ z , or yz .
yz is the most usual form of writing the product of y and z in algebra .
When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra , we write the number in front of the letter : 5 Ã -- y = 5y .
When the number is 1 , then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number -LRB- 1 Ã -- y = y -RRB- and so is not needed .
When we multiply two numbers in algebra , the only way is usually 3 Â 4 .
3 -LRB- 4 -RRB- can also be used .
The symbol '' Ã -- '' is not used , because it looks too much like the letter x.
In algebra , dividing y by z -LRB- or y over z -RRB- is written as y Ã z or y\/z .
y\/z is more commonly used .
Algebra also introduces graphing , or drawing a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation true .
Usually this is easy to do when there are only one or two variables .
The graph is often a line , and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula where b is the y-intercept of the graph and m is the slope .
This formula applies to the coordinates of the graph or .
There may be linear or simultaneous equations of algebra .
Eg .
A linear graph is drawn , equations stating x = ky is to be drawn on the graph line .
This is called inverse or direct proportion .
Inverse proportion = Downwards sloping line , Direct proportion = Upwards sloping line with a circle at the origin .
The word `` algebra '' is a Latin form of the Arabic word Al-Jabr -LRB- `` casting '' -RRB- and comes from a mathematics book Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah , -LRB- `` Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation '' -RRB- written in the 9th century by a famous Persian mathematician , Muhammad ibn MÅ `` sÄ al-Khw Ä rizmÄ `` , who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan .
He flourished under Al-Ma ` moun in Baghdad , Iraq through 813-833 CE , and died around 840 CE .
The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century .
The book was then given the name ` Algebra ' .
An atom is a basic unit that makes up all matter .
There are many different types of atom each with its own name , mass and size .
These are called chemical elements , such as hydrogen or gold .
Atoms are very small ; the exact size changes depending on the element : they range from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers .
One nanometer is around a hundred times smaller than the width of a human hair .
This makes atoms almost impossible to see .
The way they work , and how they act with other atoms has to be seen using equations .
Atoms combine to make molecules or particles : for example , two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule , a form of a chemical reaction .
Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles , called protons , neutrons and electrons .
The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom .
They are called the nucleus .
The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons with a negative charge which are bound to nucleus by an electromagnetic force .
Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quarks .
Electrons are elementary or fundamental particles ; they can not be split into smaller parts .
The number of protons , neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is .
Hydrogen , for example , has one proton , no neutrons and one electron ; the element sulfur has 16 protons , 16 neutrons and 16 electrons .
Atoms move faster when in gas form -LRB- as they are free to move -RRB- than liquid and solid matter .
In solid materials the atoms are tightly next to each other so they vibrate , but are not able to move -LRB- there is no room -RRB- as atoms in liquids do .
The word `` atom '' comes from the Greek á 1\/4 Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Î Ï , indivisible , from á 1\/4 - , not , and Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Î Ï , a cut .
The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek philosopher Democritus , around 400BC .
Atomic theory stayed as a mostly philosophical subject , with not much actual scientific investigation or study , until the development of chemistry in the 1600s .
In 1777 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier defined the term element for the first time .
He said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry .
Any substance that could be broken down was a compound .
In 1803 English philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were tiny , solid spheres made of atoms .
Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. .
He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine .
According to Dalton , in a compound , atoms of different elements always combine the same way .
In 1827 British scientist Robert Brown looked at pollen grains in water and used Dalton 's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved .
This was called Brownian Motion .
In 1905 Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms , and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom .
In 1869 scientist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table .
The periodic table groups atoms by their atomic number -LRB- how many protons they have .
This is always the same as the number of electrons -RRB- .
Elements in the same column , or period , usually have similar properties .
For example helium , neon , argon , krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties .
All these elements are gases that have no color and no smell .
Together they are known as the noble gases .
The physicist J.J. Thomson was the first man to discover electrons , while he was working with cathode rays in 1897 .
He realized they had a negative charge , unlike protons -LRB- positive -RRB- and neutrons -LRB- no charge -RRB- .
Thomson created the plum pudding model , which stated that an atom was like plum pudding : the dried fruit -LRB- electrons -RRB- were stuck in a mass of pudding -LRB- protons -RRB- .
In 1909 a scientist named Ernest Rutherford used the Rutherford Experiment to prove that electrons are very small compared to protons and neutrons .
Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil , and then shot alpha particles at it .
Many of the particles went through the gold foil , which proved that atoms are mostly empty space .
Electrons are so small they make up only 1 % of an atom 's mass.
In 1913 , Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model .
This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits .
This was more accurate than the Rutherford model .
However , it was still not completely right .
Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced .
In 1925 chemist Frederick Soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom .
For example any atom with 2 protons should be a helium atom .
Usually , a helium nucleus also contains two neutrons .
However , some helium atoms have only one neutron .
This means they are still helium , as the element is defined by the number of protons , but they are not normal helium either .
Soddy called an atom like this , with a different number of neutrons , an isotope .
To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element .
So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3 , and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12 .
However , when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed .
To prove they were real physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer .
The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms .
By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom , neutrons must exist .
In 1937 German chemist Otto Hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in a laboratory .
He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a uranium atom , hoping to create a new isotope .
However , he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a barium atom .
This was the world 's first recorded nuclear fission reaction .
This discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb .
Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom .
Using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles , called quarks .
The most accurate model so far comes from the SchrÃ dinger equation .
SchrÃ dinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus , called the electron cloud .
In the electron cloud , it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are .
The SchrÃ dinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be found .
This area is called the electron 's orbital .
The atom is made up of three main particles ; the proton , the neutron and the electron .
The isotope of Hydrogen Hydrogen-1 has no neutrons , and a positive hydrogen ion has no electrons .
These are the only known exceptions , all other atoms have at least one proton , neutron and electron each .
Electrons are by far the smallest of the three , their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology .
They have a negative charge .
Protons and neutrons are similar sizes Protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge .
Most atoms have a neutral charge ; because the number of protons -LRB- positive -RRB- and electrons -LRB- negative -RRB- are the same , the charges balance out to zero .
However in ions -LRB- different number of electrons -RRB- this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge .
Protons and Neutrons are made out of quarks , of two types ; up quarks and down quarks .
A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark .
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom .
It is made up of protons and neutrons .
Usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other .
So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together .
They solved this by finding a particle called a Gluon .
Its name comes from the word glue as Gluons act like atomic glue , sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force .
It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons .
The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay .
When there are too many neutrons or protons , the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles .
It does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha , beta or gamma decay .
Nuclei can change through other means too .
Nuclear fission is when the Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei , releasing a lot of stored energy .
This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity , in the form of nuclear power .
The other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion , when two nuclei join together , or fuse , to make a heavier nucleus .
This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons , as they have the same charge .
Such high energies are most commonly found in stars like our Sun , which fuses hydrogen for fuel .
Electrons orbit or go around the nucleus .
They are called the atom 's electron cloud .
They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force .
Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge , so they attract each other .
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others .
These are called electron shells .
In most atoms the first shell has two electrons , and all after that have eight .
Exceptions are rare , but they do happen and are difficult to predict .
The further away the electron is from the nucleus , the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it .
This is why bigger atoms , with more electrons , react more easily with other atoms .
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms
Some elements , and many isotopes , have what is called an unstable nucleus .
This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons , electrons or neutrons .
When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles .
It does this through radiation .
An atom that does this can be called radioactive .
Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass\/particles that they become stable .
All atoms above atomic number 82 -LRB- 82 protons -RRB- are radioactive .
There are three main types of radioactive decay ; alpha , beta and gamma .
Every radioactive element or isotope has something called a half life .
This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element .
Large atoms , or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life .
Astronomy is the study of outer space and everything in it .
This includes stars , planets and galaxies as well as other things .
The word astronomy comes from the Greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law .
A person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer .
Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences .
Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigation , and to find when was the best time to plant crops .
Astronomy is very similar to astrophysics .
Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy , Observational and Theoretical astronomy .
Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars , galaxies and other astronomical objects .
Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen .
The two often work together , the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works .
Astronomy is not the same as astrology , the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets make affect human lives .
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars .
They used maps of the stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year .
Early civilizations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions .
They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe .
For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe , and that the planets , the stars and the sun went around it .
This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe .
Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth .
During the renaissance an astronomer named Nicolaus Copernicus thought of a new idea .
He thought , from looking at the way the planets moved , that the Earth was not the center of the Solar System .
He said , and he was right , that the Sun was at the center of the Solar System and all the planets including Earth moved around it .
This is known as a Heliocentric model .
Another astronomer called Galileo Galilei built his own telescope , and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time .
What he saw backed up Copernicus ' idea .
Their ideas were also improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton who came up with the theory of gravity .
At this time the Christian church decided that Galileo was wrong .
The Pope gave the order to lock Galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more books until he died .
After Galileo , people used telescopes more often and began to see farther-away objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune .
They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun , but in a range of colors and sizes .
They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae .
The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy .
In 1931 , Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications , marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky .
Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy , allowing more discoveries to be made .
The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things , for example pulsars , which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space .
The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source .
The period after World War 2 saw the rise of dedicated observatory , where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites , normally by governments .
For example , radio astronomy started out of leftover military equipment at Jodrell Bank after the war .
By 1957 , the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world .
Similarly , the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii , a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies .
Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the Keck Observatory with its 10-meter mirror .
The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry .
This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites -LRB- such as those that beam satellite television -RRB- .
Satellite-based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes .
Turbulence in the Earth 's atmosphere blurs images taken by ground-based telescopes , an effect known as seeing .
It is this effect that makes stars `` twinkle '' in the sky .
As a result , the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light -LRB- for example , by the Hubble Space Telescope -RRB- are much clearer than Earth-based telescopes , even though Earth-based telescopes are very large .
By placing a telescope in orbit above the atmosphere , astronomers had access , for the first time in history , to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including those that had been blocked by the atmosphere .
The X-rays , gamma rays , ultraviolet light and parts of the infra-red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched .
As with other parts of the spectrum , new discoveries were made .
The period from 1970s onwards can be generalised that satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites , causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Making new progress in Astronomy is becoming more limited by the observatories and facilities being used at this time .
To make up for these limitations , astronomers have proposed larger and more ambitious projects .
These proposals , some of which are being examined already by governments to see if they will be funded , allow us to glimpse into what the astronomers are planning for the future of astronomy .
This section summarises all the discoveries that Astronomy has made .
Discoveries broadly come in two types : bodies and phenomena .
Bodies are things in the Universe , whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way .
Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe .
For convenience , this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found : those found around stars are solar bodies , those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies .
Phenomena are those discoveries related to events and happenings in the Universe .
Broadly , events and happenings in the Universe can be divided into three types : burst , periodic and noise .
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly .
These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a `` burst '' of energy .
Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way .
The name periodic comes from period , which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle .
Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago .
The signal from these events bounces around the Universe until it seems to come from everyone and varies little in intensity .
In this way , it resembles `` noise '' , the background signal that pervades every instrument that tries to do astronomy .
The most common example of noise is static seen on analog televisions .
Cosmic background .
This section tries to detail how astronomy is done .
Much of astronomy is done through observation of the heavens using instruments .
This section attempts to describe the various instruments used by astronomers , how they work and how they are used .
These are a list of some of the common ways in which astronomers can use their equipment to get better pictures of the heavens .
Light from a distant source reaches a telescope or satellite and gets measured , normally by a human eye or a camera .
For very dim sources , there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen .
One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration , -LRB- which is identical to longer exposures in photography -RRB- .
When a normal picture is taken with a camera , the film or CCD plate is exposed to the light for a short amount of time , which is normally useful because a short time means that whatever we are taking a picture of will not have moved much .
Astronomical sources do not move much -LRB- only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens -RRB- the film or CCD plate can be left exposed for longer than an instant .
As light particles reach the camera over time , they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible then the background , until it can be seen .
Short exposures are easy .
However , longer ones are affected by the Earth 's rotation , causing a star wheel effect .
Telescopes at most observatories -LRB- and satellite instruments -RRB- can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens , making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures .
Also , images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours , days or even months .
In the digital era , digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer , which overlays the images after correcting for movement .
Smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a larger one which is effectively as large as the distance between the two smaller telescopes .
This technique was first pioneered in radio astronomy .
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it .
The observation is first stored as data .
This data will then have various techniques applied to it -LRB- to analyze it -RRB- , out of which we may get an answer .
Fourier analysis in astronomy uses the techniques of Fourier analysis in mathematics to see if an observation -LRB- over a length of time -RRB- is changing periodically -LRB- changes like a wave -RRB- .
If so , it can extract any and all frequencies and the type of wave pattern as well .
Astronomy is a very large subject with many different things to study , and many astronomers specialise in particular areas of astronomy , called fields .
Fields are often themselves further sub-divided into sub-fields and so on .
Astronomers assign fields based on what they perceive to be the largest differences between different bodies and phenomena .
However , as astronomers learn more about the Universe , they often notice that things which they thought were different at first turn out to be similar and things which were similar turn out to be different .
As a result , fields in astronomy are a constantly changing .
A good example of changing fields comes from pulsars , which are things which pulse regularly in radio waves .
These turned out to be similar to some -LRB- but not all -RRB- of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low Mass X-ray Binary .
It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found .
Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes .
Because of its changing nature , the organization of astronomy is a very confusing thing , even to astronomers , and there are also many terms left over from previous fields that astronomers use which have both modern and older meanings .
This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy and the period they were important , plus the terms used -LRB- and what they meant by them -RRB- .
It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum , although there is some evidence this is changing .
For convenience , the fields are grouped by the major difference that inspired them .
Solar Astronomy is the study of the Sun .
The Sun is the closest star to Earth , around 92 million -LRB- 92,000,000 -RRB- miles away so it is the easiest to look at in detail .
Looking at the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed .
Changes in the Sun can effect the weather and climate on Earth .
A stream of charged particles called the Solar wind is constantly being sent off from the Sun .
The Solar Wind hitting the Earth 's magnetic field causes the northern lights .
Studying the Sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works .
Planetary Astronomy is the study of planets , moons , dwarf planets , comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars .
The planets of our own Solar System have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as Cassini-Huygens -LRB- Saturn -RRB- and the Voyager 1 and 2 .
Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant galaxies .
Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own , as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it hard for us to observe our own .
Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed and use different types of telescopes and computer simulations to do so .
X-ray Astronomy is the study of the Universe in the X-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum , especially those sources which are much brighter in X-rays than in visible light , including white dwarves , neutron stars and black hole\/neutron star binary systems .
X-rays can not penetrate our atmosphere , so all X-ray Astronomy is done using satellites and as a result , the field is recent , dating from the 1960s .
MagnetoHydroDynamics , called MHD for short , is Hydrodynamics done in the presence of magnetic fields , where Hydrodynamics is the mathematical modelling of fluid flows .
Hydrodynamics is already useful in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave -LRB- as gases behave like fluids -RRB- .
However , strong magnetic fields are found around many bodies and can drastically change how the gases around them behave , affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars , which is why MHD is important .
Gravitational Wave Astronomy is the study of the Universe in the gravitational wave spectrum .
So far , all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum .
Gravitational Waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape , which include white dwarves , neutron stars and black holes .
Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly , the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited .
Architecture is a term that means either the science of the design of structures such as houses , places of worship , office buildings , or the profession of an architect .
A person must study at an institution of higher education to become an architect .
Architecture can be about small designs such as a garage or large designs such as a whole city .
In the past , people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather .
For safety , they were often close together .
Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures , like the Great Pyramids of Giza .
The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call Classical Architecture .
The Romans , working over 2000 years ago , copied the arch from the Etruscans , who copied it from the Mesopotamians .
The stone columns , which still hold up so many important buildings , like the Parthenon in Athens , were simply copied from the first wooden posts .
Classical Architecture is very formal ; it always obeyed laws .
It used symmetry , which really means balance , and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways .
The Golden Mean was a rule -LRB- or law -RRB- which said , -LRB- to put it very simply -RRB- if you are making a room , or any other thing , it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side .
There are many laws in Classical Architecture , like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be -LRB- which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be -RRB- .
These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago .
In some parts of the world , like India , the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces .
Different architectural styles were made in China , Japan , Southeast Asia , Africa , Mexico , and Central and South America .
Later , people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture , then Gothic architecture .
Gothic buildings have tall , pointed windows and arches .
Many churches have Gothic architecture .
Castles were also built at this time .
In the East of Europe , churches usually had domes .
People were copying the Classical Architecture from the past , but adding their own ideas and decoration .
Then , in the 18th Century , the Industrial Revolution happened and people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply .
Many factories and mills were built during , or after this revolution .
100 years later , in the Victorian era , architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style , to build new churches .
Up to this point , buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them .
Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller .
For example , the cathdral in Ulm , Germany is over 500 feet tall .
However , building with stone has its limits , and building too tall could result in collapse , an example of which is the Cathedral of Beauvais , which was never completed .
Towards the end of the 19th Century , architects began to use the newer , cheaper materials like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build .
An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
Buildings can now be built taller than ever before .
We call them skyscrapers .
This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations , and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials , many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated , replaced , or abandoned .
Modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies , and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890 .
Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century , and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then .
Many famous buildings existing today , especially skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building in New York could not have been built using traditional methods .
Anatomy is the study of the bodies of living beings -LRB- people , animals , plants -RRB- .
It is like taking the body apart , and looking at its parts -LRB- organs , muscles and bones -RRB- .
People who study anatomy then look where a certain organ -LRB- or bone , or muscle -RRB- should be , or where it normally is .
The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when Egyptians began studying human anatomy .
They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver , spleen , kidneys , heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system .
Academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities , medical schools or teaching hospitals .
They are often involved in teaching anatomy , and research into certain systems , organs , tissues or cells .
There are different systems , such as the cardiovascular system -LRB- the system that gets blood around the body -RRB- , the muscular system -LRB- the system that contains muscles -RRB- , the nervous system -LRB- the system that controls the nerves -RRB- , and the skeleton -LRB- the bones -RRB- .
Human anatomy , physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences , which are usually taught to medical students in their first year at medical school
An asteroid is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the sun .
It is like a planet , but smaller .
The name `` asteroid '' means `` like a star '' in the ancient Greek language .
Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky , but they really do move around the Sun , while stars only seem to move because the Earth spins .
Like planets , asteroids do not make their own light .
Because of this , some people think `` asteroids '' is not a good name , and think that the name `` planetoid '' -LRB- `` like a planet '' -RRB- would be a better name .
Most asteroids are made of rock , but some are made of ice or metal .
Most asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .
Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System .
These rocks were too small to make a planet , and could not collide to form one .
The types of asteroids include Type M , Type S , and Type C.
In the 1600s , Gisuppe Piazzi found the first asteroid .
It was named Ceres , and is the biggest object in the asteroid belt .
Other asteroids , like Juno , Pallas , and Vesta were found later .
Today , astronomers know of hundreds of thousands of asteroids , which range from less than a mile to 600 miles across .

Ù Ù Ø Û Ø Ø Ù Ø Ù
Û Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ù -RRB- is a country located in South-central Asia .
It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east , Iran in the west , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north , and a narrow piece of land known as the Vakhan , or Wakhan Corridor , connects Afghanistan with China to the northeast .
In ancient times it was crossed by trade routes connecting lands to the east and west .
More recently Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of nearly constant warfare .
Afghanistan is approximately 251,826 square miles -LRB- 652,230 square kilometers -RRB- in area .
The population of Afghanistan is nearly 30 million , though this figure includes refugees who had fled to Pakistan and Iran .
Kabul , the capital and largest city , had roughly 2,850,000 inhabitants in 2008 .
Afghanistan is a mountainous country and mountains cover about four fifths of Afghanistan .
The main range is the Hindu Kush , which stretches southwest from the Vakhan .
The Hindu Kush and the smaller ranges that cover most of central Afghanistan are part of the Himalayas .
The highest peak in the country is Mount Nowshak in the northeast , which rises 24,557 feet -LRB- 7,485 meters -RRB- .
North of the central mountains are fertile plains and foothills .
The southwestern part of the country consists mostly of deserts , the largest being the sandy Rigestan .
Afghanistan 's rivers are fed by melting snow and glaciers in the mountains .
Northern streams flow toward the Amu Darya , which forms part of the country 's northern border .
The Amu Darya is Afghanistan 's largest river ; but the Helmand River in the southwest is longer .
The Kabul River provides water for the fertile valleys and basins around Kabul and Jalalabad .
Afghanistan generally has a dry climate with very cold winters and hot summers .
In the winter temperatures drop below 0 Â â F -LRB- -18 Â â C -RRB- in the windswept mountain regions .
Summer temperatures in the desert reach as high as 115 Â â F -LRB- 46 Â â C -RRB- .
Drought sometimes causes serious problems for the country 's farmers .
Dust storms and sandstorms are common .
The country is rich in the vibrant blue stone , lapis lazuli , which was used to decorate the tomb of the Egyptian king Tutankhamun .
Southern Afghanistan has little vegetation because of the dry climate .
The plant cover becomes denser toward the north , where rainfall is more plentiful .
The high mountains have tall forests of pine and fir .
Cedar , oak , walnut , alder , and ash trees grow at lower elevations .
Many of Afghanistan 's wild animals roam the mountains .
Among them are wolves , foxes , hyenas , jackals , bears , and wild goats .
Gazelles , wild dogs , and wild cats such as the snow leopard are widespread .
The country 's birds include vultures and eagles .
The rhesus macaque and the red flying squirrel are found in the warmer southern areas of the country .
Decades of war , hunting , and years of drought have reduced the wildlife population in Afghanistan .
Tigers used to roam the hills , but they are now extinct .
Bears and wolves have been hunted nearly to extinction .
Throughout history many different groups of people have migrated through or invaded the land that is now Afghanistan .
Today the people of Afghanistan , known as Afghans , have a mixture of characteristics passed down from these groups .
The largest ethnic group is the Pashtuns -LRB- or Pathans -RRB- , who make up about two fifth the population .
Tajiks are the second-largest group , making up about one third of the population .
Tajiks are the direct descendants of the Iranian peoples .
Pashtuns are also related to the Iranian peoples .
The country 's other ethnic groups include the Hazaras , Uzbeks , Chahar Aimaks , Turkmens , Nuristani and Baloch .
The Hazaras live in the mountains of central Afghanistan and are believed to be the descendants of the Mongols , because their Dari language contains many Mongol words .
The language of the Pashtuns , called Pashto , is an official language of Afghanistan .
The second official language is Dari -LRB- Afghan dialect of Farsi -LRB- Persian -RRB- -RRB- , which is spoken by the Tajik , Hazara , and other groups .
Both Pashto and Dari -LRB- Persian -RRB- belong to the Indo-European languages , but they are written primarily with the Arabic alphabet .
Uzbek and Turkmen are widely spoken in the north and Nuristani and Pashai are spoken in the east .
Almost all Afghans follow the religion of Islam .
Afghanistan is a largely rural country .
Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities .
Kabul , the capital , is the largest city .
It lies along the Kabul River south of the Hindu Kush range .
Other cities in Afghanistan include Kandahar , HerÄ t , Mazar-e Sharif , and Jalalabad .
The rural population is made up of farmers and nomads .
The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers .
The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their livestock and belongings .
Few people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest .
Millions of people fled Afghanistan for Pakistan and Iran during the fighting of the late 20th and early 21st centuries .
Afghanistan is in the path of important trade routes connecting southern and eastern Asia to Europe and the Middle East .
Because of this , many empire builders have conquered the area .
Signs that these conquerors were in the area can still be found in many parts of the country .
Afghanistanâ s centrality in the Silk Road created a rich mosaic of cultures and civilizations .
From up to 8,000 years ago through the historical periods , the peoples of Afghanistan were central in the development of world religions , played a major role in trade and exchange , and at times dominated political and cultural life in Asia .
Archaeologists digging a cave in what is now northeastern Afghanistan -LRB- in Badakhshan -RRB- , discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100,000 years ago .
They found the skull of a Neanderthal , or early human , as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago .
In other parts of Afghanistan , archaeologists uncovered pottery and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old-evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals .
Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the Hindu Kush as early as 7000 B.C. .
These people may have grown wealthy off the lapis lazuli they found along riverbeds , which they traded to early city sites to the west , across the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia .
As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan , these ancient people eventually devised methods of irrigation that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains in what would later be known to the West as Bactria .
This civilization is today called BMAC -LRB- Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex -RRB- , or the `` Oxus civilization '' .
The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the Indus Valley during the period between 2200 and 1800 B.C. .
These people , who were the ancestors of the Indo-Iranians , used the term `` Aryan '' as a religious , cultural , and ethnic self designation .
Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people ; the Avesta of Iranian people and the Vedas of Indo-Aryans .
According to the Avesta , Aryans settled in sixteen districts in the area , beginning with Airiana vaejo -LRB- `` Land of Aryans '' , most likely in the north of today 's Afghanistan -RRB- , and following with BÄ xÎ Ä `` = Bactria or Balkh ; NisÄ ya = a district between Margiana and Bactria ; HarÅ iva = Areia or HerÄ t ; VaÄ `` kÉ rÉ ta = GandhÄ ra ; UrvÄ = Ghazni region ; Haraxá aitÄ `` = Arachosia or Kandahar ; HaÄ `` tumant = Helmand region ; RaÎ a = a district north of Haraxá aitÄ `` and HaÄ `` tumant ; Ä axra = Ä arx between Ghazni and Kabul , in the valley of Logar .
The old Greek writers knew them and called the land of these Aryan settlers Ariana .
Zoroaster , the founder of the Zoroastrian religion , the world 's earliest monotheistic religion , lived in the area -LRB- somewhere north of today 's Afghanistan -RRB- , around 1000 B.C.
By the middle of the sixth century BC , the Achaemenids conquered the land , which was previously conquered by the Medes , and made it part of the Persian empire .
Alexander the great defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BC .
He founded few cities in the area and Greek culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period , right up to the Islamic conquest in the 7th century A.D. .
After Alexander the great , Greco-Bactrians , Scythians , Kushans , Parthians and Sassanians took over .
Kushans spread Buddhism from India in the 1st century B.C. , and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the 7th century .
The Buddhas of Bamyan were the remainder of Buddhism in Afghanistan .
Those giant statues were destroyed by the hard-line ruling Taliban in 2001 , despite international protests in defense of the priceless art .
The Taliban believed that those ancient statues were un-Islamic .
Arabs introduced Islam in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion .
In the 9th and 10th centuries , numerous local Islamic dynasties rose to power .
One of the earliest was the á Ä hirids of KhorÄ sÄ n , whose kingdom included Balkh and HerÄ t ; they established virtual independence from the Ê AbbÄ sid Caliphate in 820 .
The á Ä hirids were succeeded in 867 â `` 869 by a native dynasty from SÄ `` stÄ n , the á cents affÄ rids .
Local princes in the north soon became feudatories of the powerful SÄ mÄ nids , who ruled from Bukhara .
From 872 to 999 Bukhara , Samarkand , and Balkh enjoyed a golden age under SÄ mÄ nid rule .
Turkish Ghaznavids took over in the 10th century and made Ghazni and Bust -LRB- Lashkar GÄ h -RRB- their capitals .
Maá mÅ `` d , a great Ghaznavid sultan , conquered the Punjab and Multan and carried his raids into the heart of India .
The north-eastern parts of the Persian empire were locally recognized as KhorÄ sÄ n , being literally the â Land of the Sunâ , which was a prosperous and important province of Persia , as it was the seat of many rulers .
It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating Mongol invasion of the thirteenth century .
Khorasan reached its peak of civilization in the twelfth century , and cities like HerÄ t , Balkh and Ghazni -LRB- all in today 's Afghanistan -RRB- were centres of science and culture .
The New Persian literature arose and flourished in Khorasan .
The early Persian poets such as Rudaki were from Khorasan .
Moreover , Ferdowsi , the author of Shahnameh , the national epic of Iran , and Rumi , the famous Sufi poet , were also from Khorasan .
It has produced scientists such as Avicenna , Al-Farabi , Al-Biruni , Omar KhayyÃ m , Al-Khwarizmi , and many others who are widely well-known for their significant contributions in various domains such as mathematics , astronomy , medicine , physics , geography , and geology .
Mongols came in the 13th century and destroyed much of the Persian region .
Timur , the Turkic conqueror , took over a large part of the country in the end of 14th century .
Timur 's successors , the Timurids -LRB- 1405 â `` 1507 -RRB- , were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of HerÄ t with fine buildings .
Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity .
In the late middle ages , there was a region in the south of Khorasan and along the Sulaiman mountains -LRB- in the west of today 's Pakistan -RRB- which was called `` Afghanistan '' and it was the homeland of Afghans or Pashtuns .
From the 16th to the early 18th century , Afghanistan was controlled between the Safavids of Persia and Moghul rulers of India .
Safavids and Mughals sometimes occasionally oppressed the Afghans .
In 1709 , the Hotaki tribe of Afghans revolted and fully defeated the Shia Safavid Persians and then the Mughals of India in 1747 .
A great Pashtun leader named Ahmad Shah Durrani is considered the founder of Afghanistan as a united country .
After the Persian ruler of the region was killed in 1747 , Durrani was crowned king .
During his rule he created a unified country out of lands that had been controlled by local rulers .
During the 1800s , Afghanistan became involved in a rivalry between the British and Russian empires and served as a buffer zone between these two empires .
Russia was the great power to the north , and Britain controlled India to the east .
As Russia expanded southward across central Asia , Britain believed that its control over India was threatened .
To stop the Russian advance , Britain tried to conquer Afghanistan .
Britain fought wars in Afghanistan from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880 , winning some control over the country 's affairs .
In a third war , however , Afghanistan won independence from Britain in 1919 , when the king of Afghanistan , Amanullah Khan , declared independence from United Kingdom control over Afghan foreign affairs .
After independence Afghanistan continued as a monarchy .
From the 1930s into the 1970s the country was ruled by stable governments with a king as head of state .
In 1973 , however , political crises led to the overthrow of the king .
The country 's new leaders ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a republic .
In 1978 a Communist political party supported by the Soviet Union seized control of Afghanistan 's government .
This move sparked rebellions throughout the country .
The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance .
The Soviets took advantage of the situation and invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 .
Most of the people of Afghanistan opposed the Soviet presence .
For nearly a decade anti-Communist Islamic forces known as mujahideen fought the invaders .
The United States and other anti-Soviet countries supported the mujahideen .
The Soviet Army lost more than 10,000 soldiers in Afghanistan , and millions of Afghans left the country for Pakistan and Iran .
In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops .
After the Soviets left , various Afghan groups began fighting for control of the country .
A very conservative Islamic group known as the Taliban emerged as the most powerful of these groups .
By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over most of Afghanistan .
Small groups continued to fight against the Taliban in the northern part of the country .
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of Islamic law .
People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given harsh public punishments .
In addition , the Taliban severely restricted the rights of women .
Because of such policies , most countries did not consider the Taliban to be the legitimate , or lawful , government of Afghanistan .
The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live in Afghanistan .
Among them were Osama bin Laden and members of his organization , al-Qaeda .
In September 2001 the United States blamed bin Laden for terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington , D.C. .
The Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden to the United States .
In response , the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against the Taliban in October 2001 .
Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government came to power , but fighting continued .
In December 2004 , Hamid Karzai , became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is a newly formed democracy .
Under the new constitution , the president and two vice presidents are elected every five years .
The International Security Force Assistance -LRB- ISAF -RRB- helps the government maintain peace and rebuild the country .
The government still faces problems with the Taliban , internal security , and public services .

The capital of Austria is Vienna -LRB- Wien -RRB- .
Austria is more than a thousand years old .
Its history can be followed to the ninth century .
At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria .
The name `` Ostarrichi '' is first written in an official document from 996 .
Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word Ã -- sterreich .
Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states : Vorarlberg , the Tyrol , Salzburg , Carinthia , Styria , Upper Austria , Lower Austria , Vienna and Burgenland .
It is a neutral state , that means it does not take part in wars with other countries .
Austria is in the United Nations since 1955 and in the European Union since 1995 .
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time .
The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age .
That was the time of the Neanderthals .
They left works of art such as the Venus of Willendorf .
In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for mineral resources , especially copper .
Ã -- tzi , a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy , is from that time .
In the Bronze Age people built bigger settlements and fortresses , especially where there were mineral resources .
Salt mining began near Hallstatt .
At that time , Celts began to form the first states .
The Romans settled in most of modern Austria .
They built larger cities .
The most important of these were Carnuntum -LRB- near Vienna -RRB- , Virunum -LRB- north of Klagenfurt -RRB- and Teurnia -LRB- near Spittal an der Drau -RRB- .
Austria was an empire from about 800 to 1918 and was ruled by The House of Habsburg for most of that period .
Then it became a republic .
The First Republic was from 1918 to 1938 , the Second Republic has been from 1945 .
From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany .
Austria is a largely mountainous country since it is partially located in the Alps .

Armenia is a country in the Caucasus region of Europe .
Its capital city is Yerevan .
Armenia received its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Armenia touches Turkey , Georgia , Azerbaijan , and Iran .
There are some minorities living in Armenia , such as Greek , Russian , and other minorities , and more than 90 % of the people are ethnic Armenians .
Also , the Armenian Apostolic Church , is by far the largest religion in the country .
There are a small amount of other Christians , Muslims and atheists .
Armenia is the place that some Christians believe Noah 's Ark landed , and Noah 's family settled .
The Armenian name for Armenia -LRB- Hayastan -RRB- means Land of Haik .
Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of Noah .
Throughout history , Armenia 's size has changed many times .
Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once .
In 80 BC , the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Iran , Iraq , Azerbaijan , and , of course , Armenia .
From 1920 to 1991 , Armenia was a Communist country as a member of the Soviet Union .
Today , Armenia 's borders are locked with Turkey and Azerbaijan , due to conflicts .
In 1992 , Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of Nagorno-Karabakh .
The fighting stopped in 1994 , and Armenia has had control over this land , but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land .
Archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and artifacts -LRB- historical things -RRB- left by the people who lived long ago .
These remains can include old coins , tools , buildings , and garbage .
Archaeologists , the people who study archaeology , use these remains to understand how people lived .
Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past , because so many people use the past to know where they come from .
When archaeologists do fieldwork , they look for remains , often by digging deep in the ground .
When things are found , or even when nothing is found , the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist 's base , perhaps a university or museum .
They record every piece of information by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer , so that they can build a picture of everything that is found .
As settlements -LRB- places where people lived in groups -RRB- change and grow , old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings .
Ancient Rome , for example , is now up to 40 feet -LRB- 12 metres -RRB- below the present city .
This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time .
Archaeologists do not all study the same civilizations , but they specialize in different areas of interest .
Some fields of interest include Ancient Egypt -LRB- these specialists are called Egyptologists -RRB- , Ancient Greece , or the Vikings .
Archaeologists study every civilization that is known , especially the ones where there is no written history .
They can study any time period .
For example , one might study the beginning of human life in Africa , or one might study World War II .
Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater .
They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea .
Stonehenge , in England is a famous archaeological site , or place .
Other famous sites include Angkor Wat , Machu Picchu , and Great Zimbabwe .
In many countries , governments and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them .
Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings .
Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens , because people building are always in a hurry .
Quite often as soon as the archaeologists have finished their work , the remains that they have found will be covered over , unless they are of very great importance .
Animals are metazoan living things .
They do not make their own food by themselves .
Animals usually eat other living things -LRB- animals , plants , fungi , etc. -RRB- to get energy to live .
Some are parasites , and some have photosynthetic protists as symbionts .
There are millions of animal species .
Some are big and some are small ; some are fat and some are tall .
Some live in water , others live on the ground and some animals can fly .
Being able to move from one place to another is a distinctive trait -LRB- characteristic -RRB- of an animal .
Some animals eat only plants ; they are called herbivores .
Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores .
Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores .
Animals are divided into groups ; see animalia .
Their mode of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition because they eat other living organisms as food in order to survive .
There are animals living in solitary and in groups .
Examples of animals living in solitary are tigers , rhinoceros , cheetahs and more .
Examples of animals living in groups are coyotes , bees , monkeys and more .
Animals living in solitary do not have to share food with each other .
Animals living in groups have better protection against becoming the prey of others .
Bees and ants are grouped in a special group called a colony .
In a colony , the animals work together in a special way and usually have a leader .
The leader of the bees is called the Queen Bee .
The animal kingdom is varied .
There are many types of animals .
But , the common animals you know are only about 3 % of the animal kingdom .
There are many other animals , such as insects and sponges .
Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups , the invertebrates , and the vertebrates .
The vertebrates are animals with a backbone , or spine , and the invertebrates without .
Invertebrates include insects , crustaceans , molluscs , corals , worms , and much more .
The vertebrates are divided into 5 groups , fish , birds , amphibians , reptiles and mammals .
Animals breathe Oxygen to live .
Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes .
Acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time .
Acceleration is a vector , and therefore includes both a size and a direction .
Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object .
Acceleration can be found by using :
Sometimes the change in velocity is written as Î '' .
Sometimes the change in time is written as Î '' t.
In difficult situations , the acceleration can be calculated using mathematics : in calculus , acceleration is the derivative of the velocity -LRB- with respect to time -RRB- , .
Acceleration has its own units of measurement .
For example , if velocity is measured in meters per second , and if time is measured in seconds , then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared -LRB- m\/s2 -RRB- .
Acceleration can be positive or negative .
When the acceleration is negative -LRB- but the velocity does not change direction -RRB- , it is sometimes called deceleration .
For example , when a car brakes it decelerates .
Physicists usually only use the word `` acceleration '' .
There are rules for how things move .
These rules are called `` laws of motion '' .
Isaac Newton is the scientist who first wrote down the main laws of motion .
According to Newton 's Second Law of Motion , the force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object 's mass -LRB- the amount of `` stuff '' the object is made from or how `` heavy '' it is -RRB- .
The formula of Newton 's Second Law of Motion is , where is the acceleration , is the force , and the mass. .
This formula is very well-known , and it is very important in physics .
Newton 's Second Law of Motion , in short `` Newton 's Second Law '' , is often one of the first things that physics students learn .
Black pudding is an English name for blood sausage .
It is food made by cooking down the blood of any mammal -LRB- usually pigs or cattle -RRB- with meat , fat or filler until it is thick enough to congeal -LRB- become firm or solid -RRB- when cooled .
In England blood sausage is called Black Pudding .
The ingredients include pig 's blood , suet , bread , barley and oatmeal .
The most common kind of German blutwurst is made from fatty pork meat , beef blood and filler such as barley .
Though already cooked and `` ready to eat '' it is usually served warm .
Other kinds of blood sausage include boudin noir -LRB- France -RRB- , boudin rouge -LRB- Creole and Cajun -RRB- and morcilla -LRB- Spain -RRB- .
A legend says that blood sausage was invented in a bet between two Bavarian butchers drunk on the alcoholic drink absinthe during the 14th century .
Homer 's Odyssey from Ancient Greece says that `` As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted ... '' .
A boot is a type of footwear that protects the foot and ankle .
Boots are higher and larger than shoes and sandals .
Some boots are high enough to protect the calves -LRB- lower part of the leg -RRB- as well .
Some boots are held on with bootstraps or bootlaces .
Some also have spats or gaiters to keep water out .
Most have a very strong boot sole , the bottom part of a boot .
People in English-speaking countries refer to boots in a figurative or joking manner when they tell someone `` to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps '' .
This is a joke because it is impossible for someone to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps .
What the person is really saying is `` figure out your problem yourself '' or `` find your own way to better your situation . ''
As well , people sometimes use the term to bootstrap .
This is an idiom meaning `` to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better . ''
The word `` boot '' is also used to describe how a computer starts up when a person presses the `` on '' button .
Another term `` To boot '' is an idiom meaning also .
For example , people say `` he had a beer , and a whiskey to boot . ''
This means that the person had a beer , and also had a glass of whiskey .
Another slang use of the word `` boot '' is to say `` Fred got the boot from the company . ''
This means that Fred got fired from the company .
Bancruptcy is when someone or an organization does not have enough money to pay all of its debt is insolvent .
If it applies for protection by law it may then be bankrupt .
In many countries a company or business can `` file for bankruptcy protection '' so that creditors can not destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away .
All this provides is more time to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money .
An individual person who owes debt and can not pay it can also `` declare bankruptcy '' .
That person will lose all but some basic things they own , but all the debt will go away .
Normally they can not easily borrow money again for years .
Very often , a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery , if the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt .
This is a human rights problem in very many countries .
Also , some creditors continue to bother a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not , hoping that the debtor will pay them money they might not otherwise get .
Breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs .
Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage , such as Polish or Italian-style sausages .
Breakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages , which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased -LRB- unless they are frozen -RRB- .
Uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer .
Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water , because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans .
Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked .
They are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast , often with cooked eggs , pancakes , and toasted bread .
Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes , such as `` toads in the hole '' a cooked egg dish .
Different types made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found .
There are also vegetarian types that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat .
Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll , or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness .
Beekeeping or apiculture is the farming of honeybees .
The keeping of bees is usually , and has been in the past , for honey .
That is becoming less true .
Instead , it is more used for crop pollination and other products .
These are wax and propolis .
There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest .
She lays all the eggs , which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons .
However , they do not control the hive .
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit .
Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a hobby .
British English is the kind of English language which is used in the United Kingdom and countries that used to be in the British Empire .
In the United Kingdom , many different people say words in different ways .
For example : a man from a place near London may not say his `` r `` s the same as a man from Scotland or a man from Northern Ireland .
In fact , people 's languages are different across the UK , depending on the area you are in for example in Wales one might speak welsh or in Ireland Irish -LRB- although they are not part of the UK -RRB- .
across the country the accent is different for instance in Liverpool one speaks with a `` scouse '' accent or in London one speaks with a `` cockney '' accent .
Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt .
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English .


In British English , `` dock '' refers to the water in the space between two `` piers '' or `` wharfs '' .
In American English , the `` pier '' or `` wharf '' could be called a `` dock '' , and the water between would be a `` slip '' .
The word being means the same as `` person '' .
Men , women , and children are human beings .
Some people write stories or make movies about beings from other planets .
Most religions talk about supernatural beings , for example spirits , angels , devils , gods , or God .
Being is something THAT IS .
Beijing -LRB- Chinese : å -- ä \/ BÄ ijÄ `` ng \/ -RRB- is the capital of the People 's Republic of China .
The city used to be known as Peking .
It is located in the northern and eastern parts of the country .
The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China .
Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work .
Nearly 15 million people live there .
In 2008 Beijing hosted the Olympic Games .
Beijing is well known for its ancient history .
Since the Jin dynasty , Beijing has been the capital of several dynasties , including the Yuan , Ming , Qing , and others .
There are many places of historic interest in Beijing .
These places include the Summer Palace , the Temple of Heaven , and the Great Wall of China .
Beijing means `` the northern capital '' in the Chinese language .
It was once a counterpart of Nanjing , `` the southern capital '' , during the Ming Dynasty .
This dynasty gave Beijing its name .
The center of Beijing was settled in the 1st millennium BC .
In those days , the Kingdom of Yan -LRB- ç -RRB- set up their capital where Beijing is today .
They called it Ji -LRB- è `` -RRB- .
After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed , the city became smaller , although it was still an important place .
Beijing became more important again in the 10th century , when the Jin dynasty set its capital there .
This city was destroyed by Mongol forces in 1215 .
Then in 1267 , Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital , and called it `` Great Capital '' -LRB- å é 1\/2 -RRB- , which was the beginning of modern Beijing .
When Kublai Khan , the Mongolian monarch , set up the Yuan dynasty , this city became his capital .
The Yuan , Ming , and Qing dynasties all made Beijing their capitals .
When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up , the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing .
When the People 's Republic of China seized power , Beijing became the capital of China again .
Beijing is the education center of People 's Republic of China .
More 500 famous universities of China are located in Beijing .
They also include 5 of the top universities : Peking University , Tsinghua University , China People University , Beijing Normal University and Beihang University .
Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language .
The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect , so over 70 % foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies .
A bottle is a small container used to carry liquids .
Bottles can be many different sizes .
Bottles are usually made of glass or plastic .
Milk , wine , lemonade and water are often put into bottles .
The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that have many seeds and can be used as food .
Some examples are strawberry , raspberry , blueberry , and lingonberry .
A berry can be either one fruit -LRB- like strawberry -RRB- or many fruits joined together like raspberry -RRB- .
When botanists talk about berries , they mean a simple fruit produced from a single ovary .
They sometimes call this true berry , to distinguish it from false berries .
By that statement of how words are used , grapes or tomatoes are true berries .
The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of an pericarp which can be taken as food .
The flowers of these plants have a upper ovary formed by the fusion of two or more carpels .
The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary .
Berries are small , sweet , liquid , bright colored fruits .
Due to this , they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds .
Some fruits that are called berries in English are not true berries by the use of words above .
These include strawberries , blackberries , raspberries and boysenberries .
Some true berries do not have berry in their name .
These include tomatoes , eggplants , cranberries , guavas , pomegranates and chillies .
Pumpkins , cucumbers , melons , oranges and lemons are differently made berries .
To boil water is to make it hot so that it begins to make bubbles and turns into steam .
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius -LRB- 212 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- .
At high altitudes in the mountains , water boils at a lower temperature , because of the lower atmospheric pressure in high places .
To boil food is to cook it in boiling water .
The word `` boil '' also has a different meaning .
A boil can also be an infection of the skin .
A boil of the skin is a red place on the skin that is very painful .
The person also may have a fever .
The infection is caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus .
A beard is the hair growing on the lower part of a man 's face .
The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is a mustache .
When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin , it is called a soul patch .
Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard , and some have very little .
In the modern world , many men shave part or all of their beards , or cut their beard so it does not get very long .
Some animals also have hair like this , and people sometimes also call this hair a beard .
In light , black is lack of all color .
In painting , however , the black pigment is the combination of all colors .
In heraldry , black is called `` sable '' .
Black is associated with power , elegance , formality , anarchy , death , evil , and mystery .
Black is a color associated with fear and the unknown -LRB- black holes -RRB- .
It can have a negative meaning -LRB- blacklist , ` black death ' , black cat -RRB- or a positive meaning -LRB- ` in the black ' , ` black is beautiful ' -RRB- .
Black can stand for strength and authority .
It can be a formal , elegant , and prestigious color -LRB- black tie , black Mercedes , black taco -RRB- .
Black clothing is common in emo and goth subculture .
Bubonic plague is the best-known form of the disease plague , which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis .
The name bubonic plague is specific for this form of the disease , which enters through the skin , and travels through the lymphatic system .
If the disease is left untreated , it kills about half its victims , in between three and seven days .
This disease may have been the Black Death , a disease which killed tens of millions of people in Europe , in the Middle Ages .
Symptoms of this disease include coughing , fever , and black spots on the skin .
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague .
The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea , that lives on rats .
Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days .
A Sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the bloodstream .
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs .
About 95 % of all people with this form will die .
Incubation period is only one to two days .
This is the most harmless form .
It will result in a little fever .
After that , there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time .
During the 1300s , this epidemic struck parts of Asia , North Africa , and Europe .
Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it .
Unlike catastrophes that pull communities together , this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people 's trust in one another .
Giovanni Boccaccio , an Italian writer of the time , described it : `` This scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers , uncles their nephews , sisters their brothers , and in many cases wives deserted their husbands .
But even worse , ... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children . ''
The plague was not just carried by rats as some people assume .
The fleas also carried it .
It came abroad from Kaffa by the Black Sea .
From there the disease started to go new places in 1347 .
It went to England in 1349 .
There it killed half of the people in England .
70 % of people who got plague died .
Pigs are also to blame for the transmission , as the bacteria stayed in their blood system , and when eaten , people caught the plague .
This is a reason why so few Jews caught the disease .
In the 20th century , some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague .
They did research to use it for biological warfare .
Samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled .
There is much paranoia -LRB- fear -RRB- about it .
Dr. Thomas C. Butler , a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes .
This happened after he said he lost samples of Yersinia pestis .
This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague .
The FBI did not find the samples .
They do not know what happened to them .
Biology is the science of life and living things , like plants , animals , fungi -LRB- such as mushrooms -RRB- , and bacteria .
People who study biology are called biologists .
Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work , and what they are like .
Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment .
It has existed as a science for about 200 years , and was preceded by natural history .
Biology has many research fields and branches .
Like all sciences , biology uses the scientific method .
This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas , and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves .
`` What are the characteristics of this living thing ? ''
-LRB- comparative anatomy -RRB- ; `` How do the parts work ? ''
-LRB- physiology -RRB- ; `` How should we group living things ? ''
-LRB- classification , taxonomy -RRB- ; `` What does this living thing do ? ''
-LRB- behavior , growth -RRB- ; `` How does inheritance work ?
-LRB- genetics -RRB- ; `` What has been the history of life ? ''
-LRB- palaeontology -RRB- .
How do organisms relate to their environment ?
-LRB- ecology -RRB- .
All modern biology is influenced by evolution , which answers the question : `` How has the living world come to be as it is ? ''
Botany is the study of plants .
It is a science .
It is a branch of biology , and is also called plant biology .
It is sometimes called phytology .
Scientists who study botany are called botanists .
They want to learn about how plants work .
Belgium -LRB- BelgiÃ `` in Dutch , Belgique in French and Belgien in German -RRB- is a country in Europe .
It is next to France , Luxembourg , Germany , and the Netherlands .
The name ` Belgium ' comes from ` Gallia Belgica ' , a Roman region in the northernmost part of Gaul where the Belgae lived , a combination of Celtic and Germanic peoples .
The capital city of Belgium is Brussels .
There are three regions in Belgium : Flanders -LRB- where the Flemish speak Dutch -RRB- in the northern half of Belgium , Wallonia -LRB- where most Walloons speak French -RRB- in the southern half and the Brussels-Capital Region in the middle -LRB- where Dutch and French are spoken -RRB- .
Inside Wallonia is the area of the German-speaking Community of Belgium .
The community has its own parliament and government , but they are not yet as powerful as the Flemish and Walloon bodies .
Belgium is next to France -LRB- 620 km -RRB- , Germany -LRB- 167 km -RRB- , Luxembourg -LRB- 148 km -RRB- and the Netherlands -LRB- 450 km -RRB- .
Its total area , with surface water area , is 33,990 square kilometers , the land area alone is 30,528 kmÂ .
Belgium has three main geographical regions : the coastal plain in the north-west and the central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin ; the Ardennes uplands in the south-east are part of the Hercynian orogenic belt .
The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium 's southernmost tip , Belgian Lorraine .
The coastal plain is made up of mainly of sand dunes and polders .
Further inland lies a smooth , slowly rising landscape watered by many waterways , with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine -LRB- Kempen -RRB- .
The hills with many forests and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky with caves and small , narrow valleys .
Extending to the west into France , this area is eastwardly linked to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau , on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country 's highest point at 694 metres -LRB- 2,277 ft -RRB- .
Belgium is a federal country .
There are three regions , the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region , the French-speaking Walloon Region and the Brussels capital region .
Although Brussels is surrounded by the Flemish Region its importance as the national capital means it is a special bilingual -LRB- two-language -RRB- zone .
There is a fourth language group , the German speaking community of the Walloon Region , with an elected assembly and its own Minister President .
The provinces are divided into 589 communes .
Brazil is a country in South America .
It is the world 's fifth largest country .
The country has a population of 201,103,330 people .
People in Brazil speak Portuguese and it is the only country in Latin America that speaks Portuguese ; most of the others speak Spanish .
The capital of Brazil is BrasÃ lia , a city planned and built from 1957 to 1960 .
Brazil has the world 's largest rain forest , the Amazon Rainforest .
It makes up 40 % of the country 's land area .
Brazil also has other types of land ; there is a type of savanna called cerrado ; there is also a dry plant region named caatinga .
Caatinga means white vegetation in Tupi , a native language of Brazil .
Brazil is known for soccer , but it also has many other things : a varied culture -LRB- influenced by people who have come from many countries -RRB- , and a growing economy .
Brazil is the largest country and in South America and the largest economy in Latin America .
Its people include people of Portuguese or other European descent , African descent , and native Amerindians , as well as many people of mixed origins .
Brazil also has the biggest number of Japanese descendents outside Japan .
The country is the fifth largest in the world by area .
It is known for its numerous rainforests and jungles .
It neighbors Guyana , Suriname , French Guiana , Venezuela , Colombia , Peru , Bolivia , Paraguay , Argentina and Uruguay , therefore it borders every country in South America , with the exception of two , Chile and Ecuador .
The most important cities are SÃ # o Paulo , Rio de Janeiro , Salvador , BrasÃ lia , Curitiba , Belo Horizonte , Porto Alegre , Recife , Fortaleza , Manaus , GoiÃ cents nia and VitÃ ria .
People from Brazil are called Brazilians -LRB- brasileiros in Brazilian Portuguese language -RRB- .
Chemistry is the science of chemical elements and compounds , and how these things work together .
It is the study of the materials -LRB- things -RRB- that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us .
Before 1600 , people studied substances to figure out how to do things like turn lead into gold , but no one managed to do that .
This was called alchemy .
Alchemists -LRB- people that did alchemy -RRB- did discover some useful things , though .
Sulfuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered .
Only a few elements were known .
Some of them are mercury , silver , gold , and carbon .
Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s .
This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances .
These simple substances are called elements .
One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are made of two different elements , so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction .
The first element discovered after 1600 was phosphorus , a strange white glowing solid .
Elements were discovered more and more rapidly .
People separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it .
They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals .
Radioactivity was also discovered .
Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements .
Some are very common , like oxygen .
Many are very rare and expensive , like platinum .
Some can not be found on earth and can only be made in labs , like rutherfordium .
There are several types of chemistry .
Analytical chemistry looks at things to see what chemicals they have in them .
A sample job would be to see how much arsenic is in food .
Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them .
A sample job would be making acetylene .
Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them .
A sample job would be making an integrated circuit .
A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry .
It looks at plastics .
A sample job would be making nylon .
Because plastics are made of carbon , polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry .
Then there is biochemistry .
It looks at the chemistry of living things .
A sample job would be seeing how arsenic poisons people .
Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry .
There are many other small branches of chemistry .
The basic unit of an element is called an atom .
An atom is the smallest thing that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down .
A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements .
In a compound , the atoms of each element are joined together to form a molecule .
The tiniest speck of dust , or drop of liquid , that you can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules .
Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted .
An example would be mixing sand and salt .
It is just a mixture .
If it is put in water , the salt will dissolve , leaving the sand behind .
Chemical compounds are broken down by a chemical reaction .
An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate , common baking soda .
It will make water , carbon dioxide , and sodium carbonate .
A mole is a very large amount of atoms -LRB- 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms -RRB- .
The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole .
For example , the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55 .
That means about 63.55 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms .
The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45 .
That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it .
Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds , too .
Copper -LRB- II -RRB- chloride is an example .
CuCl2 is its chemical formula .
There is one copper atom -LRB- 63.55 -RRB- and two chlorine atoms -LRB- 35.45 Â 2 = 70.90 -RRB- .
Add all the molar masses of the elements together and the molar mass of the chemical compound is gotten .
-LRB- 63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45 -RRB- That means in 134.45 grams of copper -LRB- II -RRB- chloride , there is one mole of copper -LRB- II -RRB- chloride molecules .
This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants -LRB- chemicals that are reacted -RRB- should be left .
If too much reactant is used , there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction .
Acids and bases are common chemicals .
Acids release H + ions when in water , and bases release OHâ ' ions when in water .
Acids can react with bases .
The H + ion is taken from the acid by the base .
This makes water , H2O .
A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together .
An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid -LRB- HCl -RRB- and sodium hydroxide -LRB- NaOH -RRB- .
Hydrochloric acid releases H + and Cl - ions in water .
The base releases Na + and OH - ions .
The H + and the OH - react to make water .
There is a solution of sodium chloride -LRB- NaCl -RRB- left .
Sodium chloride is a salt .
Chemistry is very common in normal life and makes up the foundation of much of science .
Most objects are made by chemists -LRB- people who do chemistry -RRB- .
Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances .
Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we all use every day .
Although there are some chemicals that are harmless , many chemicals are dangerous .
For example , mercury -LRB- II -RRB- chloride is very toxic .
Chromates can cause cancer .
Tin -LRB- II -RRB- chloride pollutes water easily .
Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns .
Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire .
To stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab .
They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained .
The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly .
Computer science is the science of how to treat information .
There are many different areas in computer science .
Some of the areas consider problems in a more abstract way .
Some areas need special machines , called computers .
A person who works with computers will often need math , science , and logic in order to make and use computers .
This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things .
Computers can do some things easily -LRB- for example : simple math , or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z -RRB- .
Computers can not do some things , though .
Computers can not answer questions when there is not enough information , or when there is no real answer .
Also , computers may take too much time to finish long tasks .
For example , it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA - so instead a computer will try to make a close guess .
A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster .
Algorithms are ways to solve problems or do things .
Think about playing cards , for example .
A computer scientist wants to sort the cards .
First he wants to sort them out by color .

The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards .
He must now think about of how he will do it .
When he decides , he has created an algorithm .
After making the algorithm , the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should .
Then , the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards .
A simple but very slow algorithm could be : drop the cards , pick them up , and check whether they are sorted .
If they are not , do it again .
This method will work , but it will often take a very long time .
The name of this sorting algorithm is Bogosort .
A person may do this better by looking through all the cards , finding the first card -LRB- 2 of diamonds -RRB- , and putting it at the start .
After this , he looks for the second card , and so on .
This works much faster , and does not need much space .
The name of this sorting algorithm is selection sort .
Computer science began during World War II and separated from the other sciences during the 1960 's and 1970 's .
Now , computer science uses special methods of doing things , and has its own special words .
It is related to electrical engineering , mathematics , and language science .
Computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers .
Computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers -LRB- the parts that a person can touch -RRB- , and software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them .
A computer is a machine that changes information according to well defined rules .
Computers have existed for much of human history .
Examples of early computers are the astrolabe and the abacus .
Modern computers have changed very much .
They are able to control traffic lights , cars or locks .
Most modern computers can be used to play music or video .
The basic principle is still the same though : the computer has a set of rules , usually called an algorithm .
The computer changes information based on these rules .
A person uses a computer by telling it to do things , like playing movies or going to Wikipedia .
Computers do not know English , so people must tell their computers to do things by speaking the computer 's language .
The computer 's language is called a programming language .
Programmers know this computer 's language , and use it to write programs that tell the computer what to do .
Normal people use the programs that a programmer wrote to tell the computer what to do .
Computers can do anything that someone can tell them to do .
Computers are able to solve mathematical problems because a programmer has told them how to solve math problems .
Because computers are very fast , modern computers can solve billions of math problems per second .
Computers are used to control factories , which in the past were controlled by humans .
They are also in homes , where they are used for things such as listening to music , reading the news , and writing .
Nobody knows who built the first computer .
This is because the word `` computer '' used to mean a person who did math as their job -LRB- a human computer -RRB- .
Because of this , some people say that humans were the first computers .
Human computers got bored doing the same math over and over again , and made tools -LRB- mostly mechanical calculating devices like abacuses -RRB- to help them get the answers to their problems .
Humans have a problem with math .
To show this , try doing five hundred eighty-four times three thousand two hundred twenty in your head .
It is hard to remember all the steps !
People made tools to help them remember where they were in a math problem .
The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again .
A cashier used to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper .
That took a lot of time and people made mistakes .
So people made machines that did those same things over and over .
This part of computer history is called the `` history of automated calculation , '' which is a fancy phrase for `` the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same math problem over and over without making mistakes . ''
The abacus , the slide rule , the astrolabe and the Antikythera mechanism -LRB- which dates from about 150-100 BC -RRB- are examples of automated calculation machines .
Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again .
For example , a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again .
Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things .
For example , they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time .
They wanted to be able to program the music box - to order the music box to play different music .
This part of computer history is called the `` history of programmable machines '' which is a fancy phrase for `` The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language . ''
One of the first examples of this was built by Hero of Alexandria -LRB- c. 10 â `` 70 AD -RRB- .
He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums .
These ropes and drums were the language of the machine - they told what the machine did and when .
Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine .
Most historians agree that the `` castle clock '' , an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206 , is the first known programmable analog computer .
It showed the zodiac , the solar and lunar orbits , a crescent moon-shaped pointer traveling across a gateway that made some doors to open every hour , and five robotic musicians who play music when levers hit them .
The length of day and night could be changed -LRB- AKA re-programmed -RRB- every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year .
Some people consider Ada Lovelace to be the first programmer .
At the end of the Middle Ages , people in Europe thought math and engineering were more important .
In 1623 , Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator .
Other Europeans made more calculators after him .
They were not modern computers because they could only add , subtract , and multiply - you could not change what they did to make them do something like play tetris .
Because of this , we say they were not programmable .
In 1801 , Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave .
He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do , and he could change the punch cards , which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted .
This means the loom was programmable .
Modern computers were made when someone -LRB- Charles Babbage -RRB- had a bright idea .
He wanted to make a machine that could do all the boring parts of math , -LRB- like the automated calculators -RRB- and could be told to do them different ways -LRB- like the programmable machines . -RRB-
Charles Babbage was the first to make a design of a fully programmable mechanical computer .
He called it the `` The Analytical Engine '' .
Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea , he never built his Analytical Engine .
As time went on , computers got more and more popular .
And that stands out at the beginning .
This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over .
Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards , storing them , and then having to go find them again .
The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that .
People got very bored and very frustrated , and would say , `` There HAS to be an easier way to do this . ''
Then some bright person figured out how to make machines do a lot of the work .
Herman Hollerith figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected .
The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation -LRB- which later became IBM -RRB- made his machines , and everyone was happy .
At least , they were happy until their machines broke down , got jammed , and had to be repaired .
This is when the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation invented tech support .
Because of machines like this , new ways of talking to these machines were invented , and new types of machines were invented , and eventually the computer that we all know and love today was born .
In the first half of the 20th century , scientists started using computers , mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together .
If you remember getting bored doing your times tables , you will know exactly how they felt .
So they put together computers .
These computers used analog circuits , which made them very hard to program .
Then , in the 1930s , they invented digital computers , which made them easier to program .
Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s .
Scientists made a lot of digital computers , and as they did , they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them .
Here are a few of the computers they built :
Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems .
They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it , and a way to change what it remembered .
This is known as `` stored program architecture '' or von Neumann architecture .
John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC , distributed in 1945 .
A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time .
The first of these was completed in Great Britain .
The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine -LRB- SSEM or `` Baby '' -RRB- , while the EDSAC , completed a year after SSEM , was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design .
Shortly afterwards , the machine originally described by von Neumann 's paperâ '' EDVACâ '' was completed but was not ready for two years .
Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture in some form .
It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer .
Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s , but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture .
In the 1950 's computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes .
Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960 's because they were smaller and cheaper .
They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes .
In the 1970s , technologies were based on integrated circuits .
Microprocessors , such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller and cheaper .
They also made computers faster and more reliable .
By the 1980s , computers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines .
The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computer .
With the evolution of the Internet , personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household .
In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones -LRB- the N-series -RRB- `` multimedia computers '' and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007 , many are now starting to add the smartphone category among `` real '' computers .
In 2008 , if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world , the biggest computer maker by units sold , is no longer Hewlett-Packard , but rather Nokia .
There are three types of computers : desktop computers , mainframes , and embedded computers .
A `` desktop computer '' is a small machine that has a screen -LRB- which is not part of the computer -RRB- .
Most people keep them on top of a desk , which is why they are called `` desktop computers . ''
`` Laptop computers '' are computers small enough to fit on your lap .
This makes them easy to carry around .
Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers , because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music , surfing the web , or playing video games .
There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use .
These are called `` Mainframes , '' and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work .
You can think of a personal computer like this : the personal computer is like your skin : you can see it , other people can see it , and through your skin you feel wind , water , air , and the rest of the world .
A mainframe is more like your internal organs : you -LRB- hopefully -RRB- never see them , and you barely even think about them , but if they suddenly went missing , you would have some very big problems .
There is another type of computer , called an embedded computer .
An embedded computer is a computer that does one thing and one thing only , and usually does it very well .
For example , an alarm clock is a embedded computer : it tells the time .
Unlike your personal computer , you can not use your clock to play Tetris .
Because of this , we say that embedded computers can not be programmed , because you can not install programs like Tetris on your clock .
Some mobile phones , automatic teller machines , microwave ovens , CD players and cars are examples of embedded computers .
Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers , because computers can do things with numbers very quickly .
These data are stored as binary symbols -LRB- 1s and 0s -RRB- .
A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a bit , which comes from the words binary digit .
Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use .
A list of these instructions is called a program and stored on the computer 's hard disk .
Computers use memory called `` RAM '' as a space to carry out the instructions and store data while it is doing these instructions .
When the computer wants to store the results of the instructions for later , it uses the hard disk .
An operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do , how to do these jobs , and how to tell people the results .
It tells the electronics inside the computer , or `` hardware '' , how to work to get the results it needs .
This lets most computers have the same operating system , or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user , while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs .
Having different programs and operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things .
When a user needs to use a computer for something different , the user can learn how to use a new program .
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication .
Communication is how people share information .
Computers have helped people move forward in science , medicine , business , and learning , because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information .
They also let other people communicate with each other , do their jobs almost anywhere , learn about almost anything , or share their opinions with each other .
The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers .
A computer is now almost always an electronic device .
It usually contains materials that will become toxic waste when disposed of .
When a new computer is bought in some places , laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for .
This is called product stewardship .
Computers can become obsolete quickly , depending on what programs the user runs .
Very often , they are thrown away within two or three years , because newer programs require a more powerful computer .
This makes the problem worse , so computer recycling happens a lot .
Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly , as most people do not need to run new programs .
Computers come in different forms , but most of them have a common design .
A computer has several main parts .
When comparing a computer to a human body , the CPU is like a brain .
It does most of the ` thinking ' and tells the rest of the computer how to work .
The CPU is on the Motherboard , which is like the skeleton .
It provides the basis for where the other parts go , and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the CPU .
The motherboard is connected to a power supply , which provides electricity to the entire computer .
The various drives -LRB- CD drive , floppy drive , and on many newer computers , USB drive -RRB- act like eyes , ears , and fingers , and allow the computer to read different types of storage , in the same way that a human can read different types of books .
The hard drive is like a human 's memory , and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer .
Most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound , which is like vocal cords , or a voice box .
Connected to the sound card are speakers , which are like a mouth , and are where the sound comes out .
Computers might also have a graphics card , which helps the computer to create visual effects , such as 3D environments , or more realistic colors , and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images , in the same way a well trained artist can .
Chinese means from or about the country of China , especially a person from China or one of the languages of China .
Chinese Writing does not use letters .
It has 50,000 different characters , each one made of different lines , called strokes .
There are many different Chinese dialects -LRB- way of speaking -RRB- but they all write using the same characters .
Each line of Chinese is written starting at the top of the page and working downwards .
The lines are written working from the right to the left of the page .
However , some countries , like Singapore , writes Chinese the same way as writing English .
There are two types of Chinese writing , Traditional and Simplified .
In modern China , most Chinese people do not write the traditional way .
The government made a simpler way of writing , known as Simplified Chinese .
Many people also use a computer .
The most popular way to use a computer keyboard is to type Chinese is called Pinyin .
People in Taiwan continue to write with Traditional Chinese .
Chinese writing is often written as a type of art , called calligraphy , which means making art from writing .
Overseas Chinese is a group of people who are Chinese but are not living in or under the government of the Republic of China -LRB- Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu -RRB- and the People 's Republic of China -LRB- Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macau -RRB- .
About 78 % of the overseas Chinese live in Asia .
A continent is a large area of the land on Earth that is joined together .
In general it is agreed there are seven continents : Africa , Antarctica , Asia , Europe , North America , Australia , and South America .
Most sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents .
Others believe that Australia is part of another continent called Oceania .
They believe that Oceania is a region which includes Australia , New Zealand and the Pacific Islands .
Some say that North America and South America are one continent .
Some say that Europe and Asia are only parts of a continent called Eurasia .
Some even say that Eurasia and Africa are one continent called Eurafrasia .
When British people talk about `` the Continent '' -LRB- or `` Continental '' -RRB- they mean the European mainland .
This meaning is not used as much as it used to be , but is still seen in phrases like `` Continental breakfast '' -LRB- rolls with cheese , jam etc as distinct from an `` English breakfast '' which is a cooked breakfast -RRB- .
Continents not only move but also sometimes crash into each other .
The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent .
As these continents push against each other , they buckle and bend .
Because of this , the Himalaya Mountains , where Mount Everest is , are still being made today .
The Greek classical elements are fire , air , water , and earth .
In Greek philosophy , science and medicine , these make up a whole .
The image below has two squares on top of each other .
The corners of one are the classical elements .
The corners of the other are the properties .
Galen said these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the human body .
The elements are linked to the four humors : phlegm -LRB- water -RRB- , yellow bile -LRB- fire -RRB- , black bile -LRB- earth -RRB- , and blood -LRB- air -RRB- .
In Chinese Taoism the elements are metal , wood , water , fire , earth -LRB- é ` ã æ ã æ ã ç `` ã å -RRB- .
China -LRB- traditional Chinese : ä å ; simplified Chinese : ä å 1\/2 -RRB- is a cultural region , an ancient civilization , and a nation in East Asia .
China has one of the world 's oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization .
It has archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old .
It also has one of the world 's oldest writing systems , and is viewed as the source of many major inventions .
The first recorded use of the word `` China '' is dated 1555 .
It is derived from Cin , a Persian name for China popularized in Europe by Marco Polo .
Ancient China was one of the first civilizations .
Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing , the others being Mesopotamia , the Indus Valley civilization , the Maya civilization , the Minoan civilization of ancient Greece , and Ancient Egypt .
It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty -LRB- about A.D. 10th century -RRB- .
China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world .
Statues and pottery , as well as decorations made of jade , are some classic examples .
China 's economy and military weakened during the Qing Dynasty -LRB- around the 17th century to 20th century -RRB- and the country was oppressed by foreign nations .
In 1911 a country , the Republic of China was founded by Sun Yat-sen -LRB- Sun Zhongshan - å ä å -RRB- .
But its government was very weak .
Army leaders in different area controlled the local governments , and later fell into the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek -LRB- Jiang Jieshi -RRB- .
In 1931 , Japan invaded Manchuria , a place in the northeastern part of China .
On July 7 , 1937 , the Japanese attacked the rest of the country , starting what was named the Sino-Japanese War .
The war later became part of World War II .
The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed .
In 1945 , after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Japan surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers .
However , the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang -LRB- Nationalists -RRB- of the Republic of China -LRB- ROC -RRB- and the Communists of the People 's Republic of China -LRB- PRC -RRB- .
One side wanted to make China like Soviet Union , whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time , which caused chaos and lots of people died in the Chinese Civil War .
The Chinese Civil War was going on throughout World War II .
The Communists , led by Mao Zedong , Liu Shaoqi and others .
Later Shaoqi lost influence on Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved .
Communists eventually won the war .
The Nationalists -LRB- led by Chiang Kai-shek -RRB- fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei .
After the Chinese Civil War , the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country , the People 's Republic of China -LRB- PRC -RRB- , in Beijing on October 1 , 1949 .
Under Mao the country experienced great social upheaval during the Cultural Revolution and suffered famines during his attempt at industrialization in the Great Leap Forward .
Following his death in 1976 , China underwent open market reforms under Deng Xiaoping , and experienced rapid economic growth .
China is now one of the largest economies in the world , relying mainly on exports .
In recent history , China has had problems with protests , blocking of information on the Internet , and censorship in the news .
1989 was notable for the government killing thousands of protesters with tanks in Beijing .
China is the original birth place of Eastern martial arts , called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu .
China is also the home of the well-respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains .
The first generation of martial art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art .
Over time some art forms have branched off , while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor .
Regardless , China has brewed some of the most renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung -LRB- Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung -RRB- and many others .
Art has also co-existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors .
Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture .
China has many traditional festivals , such as Spring Festival , Dragon Boat Festival , Mid-autumn Festival and so on .
The most significant is Chinese New Year .
People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals .
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year .
It lasts fifteen days .
It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later .
On the first day of the Spring Festival , people call on friends and relatives .
Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Year 's Eve and do n't go to bed until 12:00 AM , they usually get up later in the next day .
The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the God of Wealth -LRB- Chinese : è cents ç ç -RRB- , many people make and eat dumplings -LRB- Chinese : é å -RRB- , they believe that dumplings can hold the God of Wealth and bring luck to their selves .
The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival .
On this day , the moon becomes the full moon .
People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere .
After that , they eat sweet dumpling -LRB- Chinese : æ å , å
å -RRB- , a kind of dumpling which looks like the moon .
Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan , a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period .
He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin 's diplomats ' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him .
He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life .
The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse .
They made and threw rice dumplings into the river .
They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet 's corpse .
They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish .
Such practices , eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races , become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays .
In geography , a country is a political division .
It is often a sovereign territory .
The term is most commonly associated with both state and nation , and also with government .
For example , the United States of America is a country .
Colchester is a town in the northern part of the English county of Essex .
It has a population of 104,000 people .
People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England .
Before Roman times , Colchester was Camulodunon .
This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos .
Camulos was the Celtic god of war .
The Romans called Colchester Camulodunum -LRB- written `` CAMVLODVNVM '' -RRB- .
Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD .
The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539 .
This was when King Henry VIII took the property of the Roman Catholic institutions in England .
The only part left is a gate that people still go to visit .
King Cunobelinus -LRB- or `` Cunobelin '' -RRB- was from Colchester .

Cartography is making maps .
Cartography is part of geography .
How people make maps is always changing .
In the past , maps were drawn by hand , but today most printed maps are made using computers .
Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer .
Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin , or as complicated as showing a census of a whole country .
Anyone can make a map , but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps .
A contact network is a group of people who can all quickly get in touch with each other .
It does not guarantee any kind of help or access to knowledge other than that .
A creative network , social network and power network are also contact networks .
These include some kind of guarantee or expectation of help .
Thus they involve more investment per person .
Chorizo is a pork -LRB- pig-meat -RRB- sausage which people first made in Spain .
In it there is fatty pork in large pieces , with chili pepper and paprika .
The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it .
In the western hemisphere , people know the Mexican and Caribbean sorts better .
In these sorts of chorizo , the pork is in much smaller pieces .
Different seasonings are also in it with the chili .
People eat chorizo without cooking it , or they fry it in oil .
People also use it as a part of other dishes , the same way they eat breakfast sausage .
It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork . -RRB-
Creativity -LRB- or creativeness -RRB- is the ability of a person to be creative , take part in creating , or be useful in a creative network of other people .
It is very difficult to measure , and some think it should not be measured .
The reason is that creativity can not be defined - although several attempts have been made , a shared definition of the concept of creativity still comes up short .
Some think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes .
Others recognize that even apes , other primates , other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative -LRB- for example - primates using tools -RRB- .
Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity , not imitation .
Therefore , these people say , human science should focus on it : Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas .
Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity .
Imitation would not be the focus of education .
Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture , rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar .
Intellectual interests -LRB- recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law -RRB- are a way to reward creativity in law , but they do not always work very well .
A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists , but may only pay lawyers to make -LRB- imitative -RRB- arguments in court .
Creativity is a central question in economics , where it is known as ingenuity -LRB- the ability to come up with new ideas -RRB- or individual capital - capacities that individuals have , that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already .
This is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or founder of the system can do .
In urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity - the Bohemian Index and Gay Index are two attempts to do this accurately and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity .

The Cathar faith was a version of Christianity .
It was wiped out by the Roman Catholic Church in the 13th century by a Crusade .
They were usually considered Gnostics .
The word ` Cathar ' comes the Greek word katharos meaning ` unpolluted ' -LRB- from Tobias Churton , The Gnostics -RRB- or `` the pure ones '' .
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god .
They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world , but inside their bodies there was a spirit , and that spirit needed to return to the good god .
They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person 's spirit in a new body .
They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing .
They were opposed to the doctrine of sin .
Women were prominent in the faith .
They were pacifists .
They were vegans .
They preached tolerance of other faiths .
They rejected the usual Christian doctrine of marriage and only believed in the New Testament .
An earlier 10th century Bulgarian heresy , Bogomilism and also Manichaeism started some of these trends .
They used a bible in the language people spoke .
Many other Christians used a Bible in Latin .
Latin was spoken only by the priests .
In 1145 open challenge to Catholic dominance began .
In about 1165 the first Cathars said that the Church was `` full of ravening wolves and hypocrites '' and `` worshipping the wrong God '' , right in front of the most powerful Catholics .
In 1166 the Council of Oxford in England wiped out the English Cathars .
It was also suppressed in Northern France .
In 1167 Cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France , the Langedoc nobles protected it , and many noble women became `` Perfects '' .
Parish clergy had low morale .
All this was unpopular with the Roman Catholic Church , whose Pope , the Bishop of Rome , had begun to say he was infallible from the 11th century onwards .
The pope also started to hold total authority over what was called `` Christendom '' .
Pope Innocent III 's control by 1198 was not yet firm .
In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor , and an economy that was starting to grow , and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow .
Peasants owned their own land .
Meanwhile , in other parts of Europe , peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves - the system of feudalism .
There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France .
The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system .
R. I. Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack .
However there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems : Troubadors , who combined some of the traditions of the Bards of the Celts , and Jews , were both part of the multicultural society in the South of France .
Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures .
The 12th century Roman Catholic Monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns , drawing the best people there .
The Cathars thus had little competition .
The Cathar `` Perfects '' , the so-called Good Men or Good Women , lived austere lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents .
Also , Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds .
Many 20th century Christian sects have similar beliefs .
Today Cathars would not be considered heretics .
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France .
He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land .
This was an absolution of all sin .
In the Launguedoc , on the 22nd of July 1209 , a force of about 30,000 Crusaders arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee so as to mislead and create ease amongst the Cathars thinking they we are friend not foe and demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered .
The people of the town who were mostly Catholic , said that rather than turn over their friends and kin , `` we would rather be flayed alive . ''
A mistake by the defenders of Beziers let thousands of attackers in .
Arnauld Amaury made famous the quote `` Kill them all , god knows his own `` during the assault on being asked how to tell who were Cathars .
Everyone in the town was massacred , some while taking refuge in the church .
It is guessed that 20,000 were killed , many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all .
The crusade became known as the Albigensian crusade after the town of Albi .
It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years .
The Crusaders wanted to go home , but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead .
In 1210 they attacked the fortress at Minerv and built `` the first great bonfire of heretics '' - beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation .
It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on , so devout was their belief .
The Albigensian crusade actually failed to destroy the Cathar beliefs from southern France .
This would happen by a different sort of crusade , one that turned neighbor against neighbor and brother against brother .
The shadow of the Inquisition fell over the south of France .
In 1233 , Pope Gregory IX sent Dominican monks to the Languedoc .
They set up an office of the Inquisition and sent out notices that anyone who came and confessed would be granted absolution .
People became terrified that their neighbors had said something about them , so they went and turned in their neighbors first .
It eventually got to the point where people were turning in the dead and corpses of known Cathars were being dug up on approval of the church , burned and the property they had left their heirs was taken away by the Roman Catholic Church .
A lot of this crusade was not so much about faith , at least not for the church , but monetry greed and political dominance the church considered Catharism as a rising fly in their ointment -LRB- `` the little foxes ruining the vineyard '' -RRB- a major threat to their overall control of the holy empire .
If someone were turned in as a heretic , his property was taken by the church .
In the end the Inquisition did wipe out most of the Cathars though it took well over a hundred years to get all of them .
The last known Cathar follower was burned at the stake in the early 1300s .
Cosmology is the study of `` all that is '' .
In science , it is a part of physics .
The main idea of scientific cosmology is the mechanistic paradigm which says that there is either an expanding universe , and that the laws of physics are predictable due to the geometry it `` obeys '' .
In this system , relativity is one of the most important ideas , and models of our universe are not allowed to vary much .
Many peoples have their own cosmology that today scientists do not accept .
For instance in Renaissance Europe there were thought to be crystal spheres that rotated - with all the stars on one , and each planet on its own .
These circled the Earth .
In Ancient Egypt there was a female sky-goddess who arched over the world , which was a male god .
And in other traditions , the world was a giant sea-turtle floating in a giant ocean .
These ideas were good enough to explain an island or watershed or continent that people lived on .
Since they did not travel much , this was a `` good enough '' way to explain the world they actually lived in every day .
Comparing various creation myths and world views from all over the world is part of anthropology .
This is today considered separate from the astrophysics and astronomy that provide statistics for physics to explain .
A long time ago , people thought that the universe was the Milky Way .
They thought this because they could only see the planets up to Saturn and stars .
With the invention of the telescope , our universe got bigger .
Even in the 20th century , people thought that the Milky Way was the universe .
With the Hubble Space Telescope , people could see things far away .
A city is a place where many people live together .
A city has many buildings and streets .
It has houses or apartments for many people to live , shops where they may buy things , places for people to work and a government organization to run the city , and to keep law and order in the city .
Many people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there .
A city usually has a `` city center '' where government and business take place , and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the center .
There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called `` city '' and other places are called `` town '' .
In American English , people often call all places cities .
-LRB- See below : Size of cities -RRB-
The sizes of cities can be very different .
This depends on the type of city that it is .
Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much , are very much smaller than modern cities .
There are two main reasons .
One reason is that old cities often have a city wall , and most of the city is inside it .
Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow .
If the city got too big , it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place .
People in cities need food , and the food always has to come from outside the city .
Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Siena in Italy , because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods , as well as for transporting people .
London has been changing continually for hundreds of years , while Siena , which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years .
Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large , because the streets are wide enough for cars , buses and trucks , and there are often railway lines as well .
In the US , the word city is often used for towns that are not very big .
When the first European people went to America , they gave the name `` city '' to new places .
They hoped the places would be great cities in the future .
For example , Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people .
When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City -LRB- for the nearby Great Salt Lake -RRB- .
Now , 150 years later , it really is a big city .
In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger .
The whole area is often called a `` metropolis '' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages .
The metropolis of London includes the City of London , the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill , Southwark , Richmond , Greenwich and etc. .
The part that is officially known as the `` City of London '' only takes up one square mile .
The rest is known as `` Greater London '' .
Many other cities have grown in the same way .
These giant cities can be exciting places to live , and many people can find good jobs there , but modern cities also have many problems .
Many people can not find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime .
Cars , factories , and garbage create a lot of pollution that makes people sick .
Urban History is history of civilization .
The first cities were made in ancient times , as soon as people began to create civilization .
Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon , Troy , Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro .
Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years .
Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece , Rome and Volterra in Italy , Alexandria in Egypt and York in England .
In Europe , in the Middle Ages , being a city was a special privilege , granted by nobility .
Cities that fall into this category , usually had -LRB- or still have -RRB- city walls .
The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not .
Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France , Tehran in Iran , Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England .
In the United Kingdom , a city is a town which people have always called a city , or which has got the name `` city '' status by royal charter -LRB- a special paper from the king or queen -RRB- .
Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important .
In the past , cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university .
Some cathedral cities , for example St David 's , are small , and people do not normally think of them as cities .
Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges .
The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world .
In modern Europe , any town with at least 10,000 people in it can call itself city .
Many cities that have their status from the Middle Ages are actually smaller than 10,000 people .
Cooking is a process to make food ready to eat by heating it .
People can cook food with fire using wood or charcoal , with a stove that uses propane or natural gas , or with a stove that uses electricity .
An oven is a part of a stove that is like a box .
People also build ovens out of clay or bricks .
There are several different ways to cook food .
We boil food by cooking it in water .
We fry food by cooking it in hot butter or vegetable oil .
We bake food by keeping it hot in an oven .
We roast or grill food by holding it over a hot fire .
People often cook meat by boiling , roasting or grilling it .
People bake bread .
Some breads are fried .
Usually we cook the food in some kind of pot or pan .
Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire , by wrapping the food in leaves before they put it into the fire , or holding it over a fire with a stick .
Before foods are cooked , we say they are raw .
Some foods are good to eat raw .
Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw , so they must be cooked .
Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked .
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a cook or a chef .
However , the word cooker means a machine or tool that a cook might use to cook food , such as a rice cooker .
To many people , cooking is an art .
To many other people , it is a job .
Cooking as an art is preparing the food so it tastes and looks really good .
There is a large economy for cooking in the world .
Restaurants hire skilled cooks for large amounts of money and customers pay for expensive meals .
A cup is a container that can hold a liquid so we can drink it .
Sometimes a cup has a handle on the side .
Most cups for drinking hot drinks , for example coffee or tea , have handles .
Types of cups include :
Some are expensive , maybe old , mostly painted by hand ; a few people collect such cups , and do not use them .
Teacups have a special small plate to sit on , called a saucer .
A cup is also a unit of liquid measurement in some countries .
A cup can also be an award .
A crime -LRB- or misdemeanor or felony -RRB- is an act , that a person does , which is against the laws of a country or region .
A person who does this is called a criminal .
The basic idea of what things are called `` crimes '' is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person .
Things like killing another person , injuring another person , or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries .
Also , it can be a crime to eat some types of food , such as meat of rare exotic animals , marijuana leaves , or mushrooms that contain psychedelic drugs .
When some criminals make money from crime , they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering .
Different countries have many different ideas of what things are crimes , and which are severe enough to be treated as felonies .
Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries .
Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created .
For example , a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime .
Another example , is the ban , in some regions , on texting-while-driving an automobile -LRB- or train -RRB- , as new laws created after people died from wrecks when they were distracted by mobile phone messages .
In many countries , if people say they made or wrote a book , movie , song , or Web page that they did not really write or make , it is a crime against the laws of copyright .
In many countries , helping to grow , make , move , or sell illegal drugs is a crime .
In most countries , police try to stop crimes and to find criminals .
When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal , they usually hold the person in a jail .
Then , usually , a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime .
If the court or judge decides that the person really did it , then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison .
Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed -LRB- killed -RRB- .
This is called Capital punishment -LRB- or the Death Penalty -RRB- .
There are countries in the world who execute criminals , and others who do not .
Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray .
On that website , Dr. Ray explains his `` Time Cube '' theory , which describes the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry , and time as rotating four `` corners '' .
Many scientists reject these ideas , saying that they make no sense and can not be tested .
The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice .
On his site , Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is `` stupid and evil '' .
Some of the comments are racist , especially against black people and Jews .
There are also many comments against gay people .
Many people find the site to be difficult to understand .
Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the United States , MIT and Georgia Tech .
At MIT , a dean tried to cancel the lecture before it had taken place .
Ray sees this as proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden .
The Census of Marine Life is a ten year survey of life in the oceans , starting in 2000 .
Its head is Ron O'Dor of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada .
It uses data from researchers all over the world .
More than 70 nations are involved and over a billion US dollars will be spent on it .
It is a major work of marine ecology .
It is trying to do what the World Wide Fund for Nature -LRB- WWF -RRB- and National Geographic Society did for terrestrial ecoregions - say exactly what is alive on the planet .
In this case , in the seas .
Maize -LRB- called corn in some countries -RRB- is a member of the grass family Poaceae .
It is a cereal grain that was first grown by people in ancient Central America .
It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world .
It is used as a food staple by many people in Mexico , Central and South America and parts of Africa .
In Europe and the rest of North America , maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed .
In Canada and the United States , maize is commonly referred to as `` corn '' .
Civics is the study of government .
It most often refers to studying government in high school to prepare to be a good citizen .
In college , civics is usually called political science .
Since a city has the most unsimple government problems , the word for this study is like that for city .
Calculus is a branch of mathematics which looks at things that change over time .
It tries to say what type of change it is and how big it is using functions at the exact moment at which the change is taking place .
There are two different types of calculus .
Differential calculus divides things into small -LRB- different -RRB- pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next , while integral calculus joins -LRB- integrates -RRB- the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made by a change .
It is used in many different areas of study such as physics , astronomy , biology , engineering , economics , medicine and sociology .
The word Calculus comes from the Latin language meaning `` small stone '' .
In the 1670s and 1680s , Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany figured out calculus at the same time , working separately from each other .
Newton wanted to make new math to predict where to see planets in the sky , because astronomy has always been a popular and useful form of science , and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships .
Leibniz wanted to work out the space -LRB- area -RRB- under a curve -LRB- a line which is not straight -RRB- .
Many years later , the two men argued over who discovered it first .
Scientists from England supported Newton , but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz .
Most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally .
Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton , such as its uses in physics .
Other parts come from Leibniz , such as the symbols used to write it .
They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical worldâ '' Aristotle and Pythagoras came earlier , as did Galileo , who said that mathematics was the language of science .
But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future .
The name `` calculus '' was the Latin word for a small stone the ancient Romans used in counting and gambling .
The English word `` calculate '' comes from the same Latin word .
Differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable .
It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve , figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve , or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics , among many other uses .
Many amounts can be variables , which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200 .
Some examples of variables are distance and time .
The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time .
So if a town is 80 kilometres -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away and a person in a car gets there in one hour , they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- per hour .
But this is only an averageâ '' they may have been traveling faster at some times -LRB- on a highway -RRB- and slower at others -LRB- at a traffic light or on a small street where people live -RRB- .
Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car 's speed using only its odometer -LRB- distance meter -RRB- and clock , without a speedometer !
Until calculus was invented , the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces , so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time .
This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out .
A very similar problem is to find the slope -LRB- how steep it is -RRB- at any point on a curve .
The slope of a straight line is easy to work outâ '' it is simply how much it goes up -LRB- y or vertical -RRB- divided by how much it goes across -LRB- x or horizontal -RRB- .
On a curve , though , the slope is a variable -LRB- has different values at different points -RRB- because the line bends .
But if the curve was to be cut into very , very small pieces , the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line .
So to work out its slope , a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point .
If it is done exactly right , the straight line will have the same slope as the curve , and is called a tangent .
But there is no way to know -LRB- without very complicated mathematics -RRB- whether the tangent is exactly right , and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close .
What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope -LRB- or the speed in the distance example -RRB- exactly using simple and logical rules .
They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces .
They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each .
As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in , the slope approached a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve .
They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope .
Let 's say we have a function y = f -LRB- x -RRB- .
f is short for function , so this equation means `` y is a function of x '' .
This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x -LRB- the horizontal axis -RRB- is at that time .
For example with the equation y = xÂ , we know that if x is 1 , then y will be 1 ; if x is 3 , then y will be 9 ; if x is 20 , then y will be 400 .
If we use y = xÂ , the derivative produced using this method is 2x , or 2 multiplied by x. So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve f -LRB- x -RRB- = xÂ , the derivative f ' -LRB- x -RRB- -LRB- marked with an apostrophe -RRB- will be 2x at any point .
This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation , or finding the derivative .
Leibniz came to the same result , but called h `` dx '' , which means `` a tiny amount of x '' .
He called the resulting change in f -LRB- x -RRB- `` dy '' , which means `` a tiny amount of y '' .
Leibniz 's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated .
In Leibniz notation :
Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function .
The main idea in calculus is called the `` Fundamental Theorem of Calculus '' .
This main idea says that the two calculus processes , differential and integral calculus , are opposites .
That is , a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process .
Also , a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method .
This is just like using division to `` undo '' multiplication , or addition to `` undo '' subtraction .
In a single sentence , the Fundamental Theorem runs something like this : `` The integral of the derivative of a function f is the function itself '' .
The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes , and add up the area of each of the boxes .
This gives an approximation to the area .
If the boxes are made narrower and narrower , then there are more and more of them , and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape .
One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes , each infinitely narrow , and then we would have the exact area of the shape .
Calculus is used to describe things that change such as Nature .
A coin is normally a round piece of metal that is used as currency .
Coins have been made for about 2600 years ; the first place to make coins was Lydia -LRB- modern Turkey -RRB- .
Many coins have complex decorations ; one side often has the picture of a head on it .
Most people use coins as currency .
The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things randomly .
This is called `` tossing a coin '' .
A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it .
You then look at which picture is facing up .
If the head is facing up it is called `` heads '' , if the other picture is facing up it is called `` tails '' .
Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each picture means .
Tossing a coin can be a type of gambling , which is illegal -LRB- against the law -RRB- in some countries , but it depends , of course , if something is gambled upon with a price someone risks or if it 's just merely to decide something , so it 's hard to take a real gamble with coins .
Some people see coins as a sign as greed , such as some Communists and Puritans , who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins , and ascetics , who often keep little in the ways of money -LRB- coins -RRB- , leading a `` poor '' - lifestyle .
Because coins have been made for a very long time , some people collect old coins .
They can be much cheaper than other old things , especially if they are made of cheap metals like copper .
Older coins normally cost more than newer ones , but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums , while some Roman coins cost very little .
A conceptual metaphor or cognitive metaphor is a metaphor which refers to one domain -LRB- group of ideas -RRB- in terms of another .
For example , treating quantity in terms of direction :
`` The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor , which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language , but a mode of thought '' .

Comedies may also show people telling jokes and funny stories .
People who are known for acting in comedies are comedians or comedic actors .
Comedy plays have been around for thousands of years .
The ancient Greeks had comedy plays .
Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer William Shakespeare .
Shakespeare 's comedy plays include : Allâ s Well That Ends Well , The Comedy of Errors , A Midsummer Nights Dream , and Twelfth Night .
In Shakespeare 's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes .
Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end .
This was unlike a tragedy , where the problems do not work out , usually resulting in someone 's death .
The two masks , one was smiling , the other crying , often associated with theater represent comedy and tragedy .
There are different types of comedy .
One type of comedy is called `` slap stick comedy . ''
In `` slap stick comedy , '' people just do silly things such as tripping , falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh .
Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows .
Slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent -LRB- no sound -RRB- movies from the 1920s .
A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was Charlie Chaplin .
In the 1950s and 1960s , comedian Jerry Lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies .
Another type of comedy is `` stand-up comedy . ''
In `` stand-up comedy '' , a comedian -LRB- person who tries to make people laugh -RRB- stands up in front of a crowd and tells jokes and silly stories .
Some comedians , such as Jerry Seinfeld , work as stand-up comedians as a job -LRB- way to make money -RRB- .
Other comedians do stand-up comedy in nightclubs -LRB- bars where adults drink alcohol and relax -RRB- as a hobby -LRB- activity that a person does for fun -RRB- .
A comedy is a very popular type of movie .
Some comedy movies have `` slapstick comedy , '' in which people just do silly things such as tripping , falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh .
Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner .
Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense .
A parody or spoof movie makes another movie , series or person look silly to make people laugh .
Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies .
\* There is a type of movie called a dramedy , which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie .
Comedy shows are very popular on television .
Comedy shows on television are often called `` sitcoms . ''
The word `` sitcom '' is a shortened way of saying `` situational comedy . ''
Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh .
A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space .
They are often described as `` dirty snowballs '' .
They are very different from asteroids .
In the solar system , the orbits of comets go further than Pluto .
Most are very far away from the Sun , but some come near enough to Earth for us to see at night .
They have long `` tails '' , because the Sun melts the ice .
A comet 's tail does not trail behind it , but points directly away from the Sun , because it is blown by the solar wind .
The hard center of the comet is the nucleus .
It is one of the blackest things in the solar system .
When light shone on the nucleus of Halley 's Comet , the comet reflected only 4 % of the light back to us .
Periodic comets visit again and again .
Non-periodic or single-apparition comets visit only once .
People have seen some comets when they broke into pieces : Comet Biela was one example .
Another comet was seen when it hit a planet : Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter in 1994 .
Some comets orbit -LRB- go around -RRB- together in groups .
Astronomers think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object .
In old times , people used to be scared of comets .
They did not know what they were , or where they came from .
Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth .
They said that each time a comet appeared , it would bring bad luck with it .
Whenever a comet appeared , a king would die .
One of these examples is shown in the Bayeux Tapestry , when Halley 's Comet returned .
Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine .
It was not until the Renaissance when scientists started to look at comets with less superstition and base their observations on science .
Tycho Brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth , and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon .
Edmond Halley -LRB- whom Halley 's Comet is named after -RRB- reasoned that comets are periodic , that is , they appear once every several hundreds of years .
This led to the first prediction of a comet 's return , Halley 's Comet .
Isaac Newton also studied comets .
He realized that comets make U-turns around the sun .
He asked Edmond Halley to publish this in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica .
Before Newton said this , people believed that comets go in to the sun , then another comes out from behind the sun .
All this new information and research gave people confidence , but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods .
One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that hell was , where souls would ride , being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space .
Although today we know a lot about comets , there will always be people who will be afraid when a comet returns .
Cytology is the study of the cells , especially their appearance and structure .
Cells are the small parts that make up all living things , and their effects on each other and their environment .
There are two types of cells .
Prokaryotic cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see nucleus , and do not have a membrane , or wall , around them .
Eukaryotic cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell 's functions take place , and a membrane around them .
The main organelles of a cell and their uses are :
A Christian is a person who believes in Christianity , a monotheistic religion .
Christianity is mostly about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ , in the New Testament and interpreted of prophesied in the Hebrew Bible\/Old Testament .
Christianity is the world 's largest religion , with 2.1 billion followers around the world .
Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book , inspired by God .
The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible , or Torah , and a collection of writings called the New Testament .
Views on the importance of these writings vary .
Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament , while others believe the entire Bible is equally important .
Also , while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true , inspired by God , not all groups believe that it is completely accurate .
Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is , or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly-believed truth .
The issue of `` who is a Christian ? ''
can be very controversial .
Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters .
It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with , therefore , a definition will not be provided .
Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God , or that God consists of the Father , Son , and Spirit , are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion .
Many Christians choose to go to church .
Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship .
However , some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church .
Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue , most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ , whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week .
On the other hand , Catholics believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church .
Cheese is a solid food made from milk .
It can be soft or firm .
It is made by removing water from milk .
People may store cheese in a refrigerator , to make sure it does not go bad .
Its color varies , but often it is white or yellow .
There are many types of cheese .
Their different styles and flavors depend on the origin of the milk and whether it has been pasteurized .
It also depends on the butterfat content , the species of bacteria and mold , and the processing including the length of aging .
The different colors of cheese are made by adding annatto .
Cheeses are eaten both on their own and cooked in various dishes .
Most cheeses melt when heated .
For a few cheeses , the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice .
Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria , which turn milk sugars into lactic acid , then the addition of rennet completes the curdling .
Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available .
Most of these are produced by fermentation of the fungus called Mucor miehei .
However , others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family .
Cheese is important for its long life , and high content of fat , protein , calcium , and phosphorus .
The word cheese can be used in hockey .
The term `` Top Cheese '' refer 's to the upper section of the goal net -LRB- near the cross bar -RRB- where the puck can be shot .
Example : `` You snipped that top cheese ! ''
Cheese is usually made using milk .
Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large pots and add salt and a substance from the stomach of young cows called rennet .
This curdles the cheese , it makes it solid .
There are special pots for making cheese .
Often , these pots are called vats .
Some makers do not add rennet and curdle it in other ways .
One way which factories use is using bacteria .
Other ingredients are added and the cheese is usually aged for a short time .
There are many different ways to classify cheeses .
Some ways include :
This page is about constitutions in general .
If you are looking for the article on the US Constitution , see United States Constitution .
The constitution of a country -LRB- or a state -RRB- is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work .
It tells how the country 's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office , how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law , what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed , and how the constitution can be changed .
Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution -LRB- see Rule of Law -RRB- .
On the other hand , countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions , or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others .
This can be known as dictatorship or simply `` bending the rules '' .
A Constitution is often a way of a uniting within a Federation .
Scholars do not agree whether the UK has a Constitution or not .
There is a debate because the UK has parts of its Constitution codified -LRB- written -RRB- and uncodified -LRB- not written -RRB- .
If the constitution is uncodified , then sources for the agreement are still accessible , they are just written in different various political books or tradition , instead of written all in one place like a codified Constitution .
The Magna Carta of England , written in 1215 , was an early type of constitution .
The first modern constitution in the world was that of the United States in 1787 , but some Native American tribes had similar charters before that .
The U.S. has one of the oldest constitutions that people are still using , and it has been changed -LRB- amended -RRB- many times over the years .
It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain .
At first they had the Articles of Confederation but the Articles seemed too weak so they were replaced with today 's Constitution .
A circle is a round two-dimensional shape , such as the letter o.
The center of a circle is the point in the very middle .
The radius of a circle is a line from the center of the circle to a point on the side .
All points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the center .
In other words , the radius is the same length all the way around the circle .
Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circle 's radius .
The diameter -LRB- meaning `` all the way across '' -RRB- of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the center of the circle .
Mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line .
The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius -LRB- d equals 2 times r -RRB- .
The circumference -LRB- meaning `` all the way around '' -RRB- of a circle is line that goes around the circle .
Mathematicians use the letter c for the length of this line .
The number Ï -LRB- written as the Greek letter pi -RRB- is a very useful number .
It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter -LRB- Ï equals c divided by d -RRB- .
The number Ï is equal to about or 3.14159 .
The area , a , inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself , then multiplied by Ï -LRB- a equals Ï times -LRB- r times r -RRB- -RRB- .
Ï can be measured by drawing a large circle , then measuring its diameter -LRB- d -RRB- and circumference -LRB- c -RRB- , since the circumference of a circle is always Ï times its diameter .
Ï can also be calculated using purely mathematical methods .
Most formulae or methods used for calculating the value of Ï have desirable mathematical properties , but are difficult to understand without a background in trigonometry and calculus .
However , some are quite simple , such as this form of the Gregory-Leibniz series :
While that series is easy to write and calculate , it is not immediately obvious why it yields Ï .
A more intuitive approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius r centered at the origin .
Then any point -LRB- x , y -RRB- whose distance d from the origin is less than r , as given by the pythagorean theorem , will be inside the circle :
Finding a collection of points inside the circle allows the circle 's area A to be approximated .
For example , by using integer coordinate points for a big r. Since the area A of a circle is Ï times the radius squared , Ï can be approximated by using :
Capitalise -LRB- British spelling -RRB- or capitalize -LRB- North American spelling -RRB- means to make one or more characters upper case .
The first letter of a sentence is capitalized in many languages , as are the first letters of proper nouns such as names of people and places .
In German , however , all nouns are capitalized .
It is the only language to do that .
The homonym capitalize is a different word , and means `` to fully fund as an investment '' .
Cuba is a country in the Caribbean Sea .
The country is made up of one big island and many smaller islands .
It is near the United States , Mexico , Haiti , Jamaica and the Bahamas .
People from Cuba are called Cubans , and they speak Spanish .
Cuba has a warm climate , but has many hurricanes every year .
The capital city of Cuba is Havana .
In Spanish , the capital is called `` La Habana '' .
Cuba is famous for many types of music , especially dance music such as the Salsa and Mambo .
Because Cubans come from Spain , Africa , South America and North America , Cuban music is special and different .
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards , three tribes lived on the island were the TaÃ nos , the Ciboneys , and the Guanajatabeyes .
The TaÃ nos were the largest and most common of the three tribes .
They farmed crops such as beans , corn , squash , and yams .
The TaÃ nos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world .
Then , in 1492 , Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas .
Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish .
The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards .
The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them .
Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans .
The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them .
The Spanish ruled for many years .
Cuba became the most important producer of sugar .
In the 19th century , Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers , but failed until 1898 , when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them .
Cuba became American for four years afterwards , before it became an independent republic in 1902 .
Even though Cuba was independent , the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the Platt Amendment .
In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment , but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics .
Americans owned most of Cubaâ s businesses .
The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista , who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt .
In 1959 , Fidel Castro led a revolution against Fulgencio Batista .
Castro took power of Cuba with Che Guevara from Argentina , his brother Raul , and others who fought against Batista .
Castro made many changes to Cuba and ended American ownership of Cuban businesses .
This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba .
Many Cubans also went to America because of this .
In 1961 the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and remove Castro , but they failed .
Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans , which they did .
The Soviet Union put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at America .
American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin .
This was known as the Cuban Missile Crisis .
The Soviet Union then removed the missiles .
Cuba became a communist led country like the Soviet Union after this .
The Soviet Union bought most of Cubaâ s sugar for expensive prices .
Cuba spent this money on health , education and the army .
This made Cubaâ s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world , and the army fought in Africa to support black Africans against the white South African army .
Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries .
However , the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system .
Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed .
Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba .
Most Cubans who left went to America .
Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail .
Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this , and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power .
In 1991 , the Soviet Union collapsed .
This meant that Cuba , which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union , had no money coming into the country .
The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter .
America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power .
Cuba became very poor in the 1990s .
This became known in Cuba as â The Special Periodâ .
Because of the disaster , Cuba changed to allow less control by the government , more discussion amongst the people , and private shops and businesses .
Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island .
In the 2000s , tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again .
Though Fidel Castro had remained in power , he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness .
Fidel Castro is 80 years old and was one of the longest serving heads of state .
In 2008 , RaÃ l Castro became the official president of Cuba .
For military service , men from the age of 16 to 49 years old must go to the army .
The population of Cuba is close to 13 million .
The ethnic groups of Cuba is 48 % White , 30 % Black , 22 % mixed race , 1 % Amerindian and 1 % other .
Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies .
It has many resources .
Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills .
Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle .
Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops .
Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba , and they may get it from the sugar cane .
Sugar cane is the largest cash crop growin in Cuba , and it brings in most of the money .
After that , the second is Tobacco .
Tobacco is made into cigars by hand .
A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world .
Other important crops are rice , coffee , and fruit .
Cuba also has many minerals .
Cobalt , nickel , iron , copper , and manganese are all on the island .
Salt , petroleum , and natural gas are there too .
The coast of Cuba has many bays and a few good harbors .
Havana , which is the capital , is also a port .
Other harbors have port cities .
Nuevitas is a port city on the north coast .
Cienfuegos , GuantÃ namo , and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast .
Cuba has a semi-tropical climate .
That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot , despite its being in the tropiocal zone .
Cuba has a wet season and a dry season .
The dry season is from November to April , and the wet season is from May to October .
August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean .
Because of this , most of Cuba 's port cities can be flooded along the coast .
The people of Cuba come from three different groups .
The largest group is the descendants of the Spanish settlers who came to Cuba .
The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work .
The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish .
The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same .
The communist government gives the people a basic education .
All the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old , and nearly everybody are able to read and write at least .
Reading is very popular in Cuba .
Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that came from outside the country .
The government does not approve of this , because it may reveal the lies that the government told the people in Cuba about how wonderful this life is .
The government does not want the people to read the truth in books and magazines from outside the country .
The people in Cuba still know that their government is lying .
However , they do not try to say so or change things because than they might even be put in jail .
So most of the people do not speak about it and pretend to agree with the government .
Every year , though , a few who are brave enough to ask for changes are killed or prisoned .
Communism claims to make everyone equal .
But this is different in Cuba .
The people who are important in the government get special treatment , and better houses and food .
They also go to different shops at special stores .
If normal Cuban people try to shop at those stores , they may get into big trouble .
Because of this , Cuban people must stand in long lines to buy everything at their own stores .
They are only able to buy rationed foods or goods .
Stores may run out of food or shoes before all the people have bought what they needed .
In spite of all of this , Cuban people still love their country because it is their home .
They also love music and sports .
Cuban music is very lively .
This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms .
Baseball , basketball , and track and field events are loved by many Cuban people .
Fidel Castro is the most important man in Cuba .
Like many dictators , he created a personality cult about himself .
This means that he wants the Cuban people to worship him and think him as a god .
The newspapers have pictures of him all over the country , and his speches are always printed in the newspapers and broadcast on television or radio .
But if people do not like Castro , they might be sent to jail .
Because of this , everybody cheers for him when he comes out and speaks .
Because of Castro , many times soldiers have been sent to other countries to help fight with communist rebels .
Cuban soldiers have fought against non-communist groups in Angola , Ethiopia , and Nicaragua .
But after the fall of communism in Europe , Russia has stopped paying for these soldiers , and almost all of them came home .
A cube is a block with all right angles and whose height , width and depth are all the same .
A cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space .
Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as cubic .
The basic difference in cube and a square is , cube is 3d figure -LRB- having 3 dimensions i.e. length , breadth and height while square have only 2 dimensions i.e length and breadth .
The 2-dimensional shape -LRB- like a circle , square , triangle , etc -RRB- that a cube is made of is squares .
The sides -LRB- faces -RRB- of a cube are squares .
The edges are straight lines .
The corners -LRB- vertices -RRB- are at right angles .
A cube has 8 corners , 12 edges and 6 sides .
example dice having six number denotes 6 faces .
Cost of Living is the amount of money it costs just to live in a certain place .
It includes food , housing , etc.
`` Cost of Living '' is also an episode from Star Trek : The Next Generation .
It has a `` fantasy land '' in it .
December is the twelfth and last month of the year , with 31 days .
From the Latin decem for `` ten '' .
It was the tenth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman calendar .
December begins on the same day of the week as September every year .
December 's flower is the Narcissus .
Its birthstone is the turquoise .
The meaning of the turquoise is prosperity .
Some of the holidays celebrated in December are Christmas , New Year 's Eve , Kwanzaa , and Hanukkah .
Dublin is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland .
The Greater Dublin Area has a population of 1,187,176 people .
Dublin is also the biggest city on the island of Ireland .
Dublin was built by the Vikings and is built upon the river Liffey .
The river divides the city into two parts , North Dublin and South Dublin .
Many famous writers lived in Dublin .
Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw were born in Dublin .
James Joyce is probably Dublin 's best known and most international writer .
Dublin is home to Ireland 's largest stadium , Croke Park .
It can hold up to 85,000 people .
Croke Park is the usual venue for all Ireland huling and football finals .
Dance is when people move to a musical rhythm .
They may be alone , or in a group .
The dance may be informal play , part of a ritual , or part of a professional performance .
There are many kinds of dance , and every human society has its dances .
Dancing is done for fun .
Dance is an art .
Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions .
Other people dance to feel better .
Dance can be used to tell a story .
In some societies , dance goes with song as well as music .
People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools .
It may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer .
To plan a dance is called choreography , done by a choreographer .
Often this goes with music , and fits into a certain style .
Dances may be planned in detail , or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing .
However , most dancing does follow some general style or pattern .
One style is the couple dance , where -LRB- usually -RRB- a man and a woman dance together .
Other dances need a whole group of people together to make it work .
People have always danced .
Every society has its own dances .
We have pictures , on pottery and stone , which show dances from several thousand years ago , in Egypt and Greece .
Chapter 5
Sachs divides early dances into ` Imageless dances ' and ` Image dances ' .
By ` imageless dances ' he meant dances which have no set form , but aim at getting the dancers into a state of ecstasy .
In this state the dancer -LRB- s -RRB- seem changed , in a trance , and are often thought of -LRB- by their society -RRB- as being ` possessed by spirits ' .
These dances are done on certain occasions : marriage , war , famine , illness or death , and so on .
They are found in all early -LRB- ` primitive ' -RRB- societies .
p49 ; 62
The ` image dances ' , according to Sachs , are to do with the world outside the dancer .
By imitating an animal or object , the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful .
To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them .
To imitate the act of sex is to achieve fertility .
This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance .
Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between cause and effect .
They really believe the image dances work .
The dance type which is used in image dances is mime .
p49 ; 77
The two styles of dance may be joined together .
Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime .
The great dancer Nijinsky used some of these ideas in his choreography for the ballet Le Sacre du Printemps -LRB- The Rite of Spring -RRB- , a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring .
Coming to more recent times , the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in Paris , France .
Only men were accepted until 1681 .
After 1681 , women were accepted too .
Ballroom dances are forms of modern dance .
Ballroom dances such as the waltz are done by couples .
Until the 20th century , most ballroom dances were sequence dances .
The way people moved was planned in set formation .
These formations were usually lines or squares .
Everyone moved at the same time , and finished at the same time .
The music played for a set time , and then stopped .
After the invention of the waltz , around 1800 , another style of dancing developed .
In the waltz , and later dances , people danced in couples , but they did so separately .
They did not dance in formation , but moved round the room as they pleased -LRB- but anti-clockwise -RRB- .
Now , once again , new dance styles have arrived .
Some people dance as individuals , separately as they please .
Street dance is like that .
But all these types of dance have music .
At the same time , round the world there are many traditional dances .
Some of them have been going for hundreds of years .
We call them folkloric dances .
Diarrhea -LRB- DIE-uh-REE-uh -RRB- , also spelled diarrhoea , is feces that are runny or liquid .
In a baby it is the most common symptom of malnutrition .
This means not eating enough , or well enough .
There are many other diseases that cause it .
Most are temporary and related to diet - the food you eat .
Food safety and hand washing can lower the risk of getting diarrhea .
Stress and drinking too much alcohol can also cause diarrhea .
In developing nations , malnutrition is a common cause of child death .
Diarrhea is often treated with aspirin or glucose - these reduce pain and may stop some symptoms for a while .
However , if it was because of malnutrition , it will not save the child 's life .
Spending money on rehydrating salts , clean water , and more food is wiser , as the first step .
The opposite of diarrhea , firm feces are a sign of good digestive health .
Many people adopt vegetarian diets with high dietary fiber to prevent diarrhea and other digestive problems .
A dimension is a measure of the size of something .
Dimensions can be used to measure position too .
The distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length , width and height directions .
These distances are a measure of the position .
Sometimes a fourth dimension , time , is used to show the position of an event in time and space .
In modern science , people use other dimensions .
Dimensions like temperature and weight can be used to show the position of something in less simple spaces .
Mathematicians also use dimensions .
In mathematics , dimensions are more general .
Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the world .
The rules for doing arithmetic with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules .
Vectors are used to show distances and directions .
Vectors are often used in engineering and science , and sometimes in mathematics .
A vector is a list of numbers .
There is one number for each dimension .
There are arithmetic rules for vectors .
For example , if Jane wants to know the position of Sally , Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position .
If Jane and Sally are in the world , there are three dimensions .
Therefore , Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position .
The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be :
Distance is how far one thing is from another thing .
Distance is a measure of the space between two things .
Distance is different from displacement .
Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point .
A and B are 1 metre apart .
Tom walks from A to B. Then Tom walks from B back to A. The distance Tom walked is 2 metres .
Tom 's displacement is 0 metres , because Tom started at A and finished at A.
A dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words or , more precisely , lexemes .
The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly .
The word â dictionaryâ comes from the Latin â dictionâ -LRB- â wordâ -RRB- .
There are several types of dictionaries : dictionaries which explain words and how they are used , dictionaries which translate words from one language to another , dictionaries that can define multiple words at one time , dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people , technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject -LRB- sometimes called a thesaurus -RRB- .
Some of these come close to being an encyclopedia , but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things -LRB- knowledge -RRB- and does not explain the use of the language .
Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear `` definition '' of the word -LRB- e.g. hippopotamus : a hoofed mammal with thick skin , large mouth and short legs that lives in rivers and lakes of Africa . -RRB-
Good dictionaries will also give more information about the word .
It will explain how it is pronounced .
Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for this .
It will explain how the word is used .
This is not a problem for a word like `` hippopotamus '' , but a word like `` put '' has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used .
It will also explain what language the word comes from -LRB- e.g. Greek `` hippos '' horse and `` potamus '' river -RRB- .
A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses , plural form etc.
Multi-word Dictionaries are dictionaries which offer the user the ability to define more than one word at a time .
These dictionaries perform the same task as `` Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words , '' but make the process more efficient .
There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages .
Very often one volume -LRB- one book -RRB- will translate both ways , so half the book will be translating from English to Dutch and the other half from Dutch to English .
When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word .
A word like â rightâ has two basic meanings in English : 1 -RRB- â correctâ , and 2 -RRB- the opposite of â leftâ .
Other languages are not like English : they will have different words for these different meanings .
A word like â putâ has many meanings .
A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want .
In many languages , for example , the word â putâ will be different according to whether something is being put onto something -LRB- e.g. a table -RRB- or into something -LRB- e.g. a cupboard -RRB- .
Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes .
New words are often brought into a language -LRB- e.g. lots of computer terms -RRB- or words change their meanings -LRB- e.g. â gayâ or â coolâ -RRB- .
The most famous English Dictionary is the Oxford English Dictionary -LRB- or OED -RRB- .
Words are always being added to the OED , they are never taken out even if they are obsolete -LRB- not used any more -RRB- .
The OED can be accessed online -LRB- with a subscription -RRB- .
A definition is an exact word or phrase of the meaning , nature , or limits of something .
A definition usually answers the question what .
Defining means giving a definition .
Other words with this meaning are description and explanation .
In mathematics , a definition is an exact way of saying what something is .
It might not be the easiest way to say what it is , but it is used because it is exact .
It can be used in a mathematical proof about the thing .
Denmark is a country in northern Europe .
5,400,000 people live there .
There are many islands , but there are no mountains .
Denmark is on the North Sea .
Denmark is a kingdom .
The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen .
In geography , Denmark is the land in northern Europe , where the Danes live .
In the political sense , Denmark also includes the Faroe Islands in the Atlantic Ocean , and Greenland in North America .
All three parts of the country have different languages and culture .
In 2006 and 2007 , surveys ranked Denmark as `` the happiest place in the world , '' based on standards of health , welfare , and education .
Denmark is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries .
The neighbors are Germany -LRB- to the south -RRB- , Sweden -LRB- to the east -RRB- , Norway -LRB- to the north -RRB- and the United Kingdom -LRB- to the west -RRB- .
The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jylland , the largest part of Denmark .
It is connected to Germany by land .
To the south-east there is the Baltic Sea , to the west the North Sea , to the north the Skagerrak and to the north-east the Kattegat .
The western part of Denmark is the peninsula of Jylland -LRB- pronounced yut-land -RRB- , bordering Germany .
This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island .
The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on , and many tiny islands .
To the east is the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea , the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen .
The country is quite flat .
There are many small hills , lakes , creeks , forests and farmland .
And nobody lives more than 60 km from the coast .
The weather in Denmark is quite windy and rainy .
In the winter , it does not get very cold ; in most years , there are only a few weeks of snow .
Every ten years or so , the sea around the islands freezes over , but in most winters , it does not .
The climate and topography are not good for winter sports .
Most summers are not very hot .
People always dress to be ready for rain or wind .
There are also very sunny times , but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be .
The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer .
The biggest part -LRB- 91 % -RRB- of Denmark 's population of just under 5.5 million is of Danish descent .
Of the rest 8.9 % who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants , many come from South Asia or the Middle East .
There are also small groups of Inuit from Greenland and Faroese .
The Danes speak Danish .
Most Danes speak English , too .
Many also speak German .
On the Faroe Islands , Faroese is spoken , and people living in Greenland speak Inuit .
In the southern part of Jutland , a German minority speaks German .
The Danish language is much like Norwegian and Swedish .
Denmark is divided into five regions -LRB- Danish : regioner , singular : region -RRB- .
The regions are Hovedstaden , Midtjylland , Nordjylland , SjÃ lland , Syddanmark and a total of 98 municipalities -LRB- Danish : kommuner -RRB- .
Because of the many islands , Denmark has many bridges .
The main parts of the country , and most of the bigger islands , are connected by roads and railroads .
One of the world 's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country , and there is a large bridge to Sweden also .
There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany , but it will most likely be built in a few years .
The bridge to Sweden was expensive , took a long time to build , and required much planning by engineers .
There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland .
People have to go by boat or airplane to reach these islands .
Many islands will never be reached by bridges , because they are too small or too far away .
If the island has too few people , bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build .
Somebody has to pay for it , nothing is free .
The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea .
In earlier days , people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat .
Many Danes were fishermen or merchants .
Even today , many Danes spend much time near or at the sea .
Farming has always been one of the main occupations .
Because of the climate and the soil , Denmark is a good place for agriculture .
Export of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of income for the country .
Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world .
Many Danes have become famous around the world , such as the scientist Ole RÃ mer , who discovered the speed of light , the philosopher SÃ ren Kierkegaard , the author Hans Christian Andersen , the physicist Niels Bohr , and Lars Ulrich from Metallica .
The cuisine of Denmark is like the other Nordic countries -LRB- Finland , Norway , Iceland , and Sweden -RRB- , as well as that of northern Germany , consists mainly pork meat and fish .
Traditional Danish food includes frikadeller -LRB- fried meatballs , often served with potatoes and various sorts of gravy -RRB- .
Fish is also widely eaten , especially on the west coast of Jutland .
Christmas is the main feast of the year .
Christmas is celebrated on the eve , December 24 .
In midwinter , a fast is celebrated .
Children are dressed up , and go from house to house begging for money .
A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs .
The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats .
Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of June 23 .
Most Danes have a three week summer holiday in July or August .
The most popular sport in Denmark is football -LRB- soccer -RRB- .
Sailing and other water sports are also very popular , the same are sports indoor like badminton , handball and many others .
Denmark does not currently have a King .
The Queen is Margrethe II .
Her husband is called a prince because he is the son-in-law , not the son , of the previous King .
The royal couple have two children .
In 2008 Prince Joachim married for the second time .
His new wife is from France and is called Marie , with whom he had one son .
Die redirects here , for the game-playing objects , see dice .
For the death metal band , see Death -LRB- band -RRB- .
Death is the end of life in an organism .
Death can happen in many ways .
About 150,000 people die every day around the world .
About two thirds of these people die because of reasons related with age .
Living things which have died are normally described as being dead .
Human death is very carefully tracked in case of a killing or something -LRB- like a disease -RRB- that may continue to kill other humans .
Death is usually followed by rituals like the funeral , which have been developed by a religion or the state .
When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal , those things or events are usually described as being deadly , or fatal .
In the case of diseases , they are described as terminal .
There are many slang terms for dying .
A few examples are , `` to pass away '' , `` to go to a better place '' , `` to buy the farm '' -LRB- generally used in the military -RRB- , and `` to kick the bucket . ''
In ordinary life , death is when the heart stops beating and the lungs stop breathing for more than several minutes .
There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes , such as near-drowning in very cold water .
If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work , then the moment of death is more difficult to know .
For a long time , many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die .
This is one of the largest questions of philosophy and religion .
Europe is a continent , the western part of Eurasia .
It is separated from Asia by a traditional eastern boundary that includes the Ural Mountains in Russia and the Bosporus in Turkey , and from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea to Balkans .
The Atlantic Ocean is to the west of Europe .
There are over 50 countries in Europe .
The European Union is made up of most of the countries in Europe .
Europe is named after a person in Greek mythology called Europa .
She was said to have been abducted to Crete by Zeus .
The name was later used for Greece .
Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires , the whole area West of the Ural Mountains became known by the same name .
In Europe there are different climates in different places ; for example , in the north like Finland it stays snowy in the winter for 5-6 months and is about -30 degrees Celsius .
However , during winter in Spain it is warmer and hardly snows , except on high mountains .
At this time , much of the continent shares some rulership in a body that is above any country , called the European Union .
The history of Europe is long and has many turns .
Individual specific ` eras ' - this is the term meaning long amounts of specific time - can be mentioned :
An encyclopedia -LRB- or encyclopÃ dia , cyclopÃ dia -RRB- is a collection -LRB- usually a book -RRB- of information about things humans know .
Whether published on paper or online , an encyclopedia is a collection of essays , each on a different subject .
The first encyclopedias may have begun as lecture notes by and for the teachers of ancient schools , such as Aristotleâ s school .
Each volume in the encyclopedia was for a different subject or course of study .
The word encyclopedia at first meant the teachings of the school .
After the printing press was invented , dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias .
For example , a dictionary of science if it included essays was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science .
Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject .
The word , encyclopedia , was put in the title of some encyclopedias .
Companies were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for the public use in libraries , which is different from when an encyclopedia was the curriculum of a private school .
Like dictionaries , these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles and read and choose articles .
Some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles .
Other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from non-paying users of the encyclopedia .
The word `` encyclopedia '' is Latin and comes from Greek .
The words '' Î Î Î Ï Î Î '' Î Î Ï Ï Î Î Î Î Î Î '' , enkyklios paideia mean `` in a circle of teaching '' .
It is from '' Î Î Î Ï Î Î '' Î Î Ï '' , in a circle from '' Î Ï Î Î '' Î Ï '' circle and '' Ï Î Î Î Î Î Î '' , meaning teaching .
The word '' Î Î Î Ï Î Î '' Î Î Ï '' can also mean `` general '' : perhaps the people who made the Latin name `` encyclopedia '' did not understand the Greek word well .
Perhaps the name should mean `` general teaching '' .
In Canada and the UK , and some other countries affected by the British Empire , encyclopedia is spelt mostly as `` encyclopÃ dia '' .
People have made encyclopedias for hundreds of years , but the name `` encyclopedia '' is from the 16th century .
There are different types of encyclopedia .
Some are general and have pages on lots of topics .
The English language EncyclopÃ dia Britannica and German Brockhaus are general encyclopedias .
Some are about specific topics .
For example , there are encyclopedias of medicine or philosophy .
There are also some encyclopedias that have lots of topics with one point of view or one cultural bias .
The Great Soviet Encyclopedia is one of these .
Many dictionaries have a different sort of information to encyclopedias .
Examples are the Dictionary of National Biography , the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships , and Black 's Law Dictionary .
There are two main ways of organizing encyclopedias : from A to Z -LRB- the alphabetical way -RRB- or by categories .
Most encyclopedias go from A to Z.
There are also printed encyclopedias , and encyclopedias in the computer , such as Wikipedia , the largest computer encyclopedia .
The largest online encyclopedia is Wikipedia in English , which has more than 3 million articles now .
The second largest , is the Encyclopaedia Britannica , which is the largest one that is printed .
Stacy Schiff , a writer , says that Wikipedia is not as good as other encyclopedias because anyone can change it , so some people may write things that are wrong .
Also , the way that Wikipedia works means that there is likely to be bias .
On the other hand , Tyler Cowen , an Economist , says that other non-fiction writing may also have the same problems .
Earth science is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth .
Earth science may also be called geoscience .
It is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science , which is part of astronomy .
The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere , oceans and biosphere , as well as the solid earth .
Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics , chemistry , biology , chronology and mathematics to understand the Earth , and how it evolved to its current state .
If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this : the Earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation .
The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think .
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun .
It is one of the four terrestrial planets in our Solar System .
This means most of its mass is solid .
The other three are Mercury , Venus and Mars .
The Earth is also called the Blue Planet , ` Planet Earth ' , and ` Terra ' .
The Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals , including humans .
Earth is the only place in the universe where life has been confirmed to exist .
Science shows that the Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago .
The things that live on Earth have completely changed its air -LRB- atmosphere -RRB- ; this is called a biosphere .
About 71 % of Earth 's surface is covered in salt water oceans .
Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present .
The other 29 % is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands .
Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System , particularly the Sun and the Moon .
The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days .
One spin is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year .
This is why there are 365 days in a year .
Earth has only one moon , known as the Moon .
The Earth and the other planets formed about 4.6 - 4.8 billion years ago .
They were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the Sun .
The Moon may have been formed after a collision between Earth and a smaller planet -LRB- sometimes called Theia -RRB- .
Scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off â '' becoming -LRB- by gravity -RRB- the Moon .
Condensing water vapor , comets and asteroids hitting the Earth made the oceans .
Within a billion years -LRB- that is at about 3.8 billion years ago -RRB- the first life evolved , in the Archaean era .
Some bacteria developed photosynthesis , which lets plants make food from the Sun 's light and water .
This released a lot of oxygen into the atmosphere or air , making the Earth 's surface suitable for life .
This oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects the Earth from bad ultraviolet radiation from the Sun .
This protection made it possible for things to move from the deep ocean to the surface .
Long ago almost all land was in one place .
This is called a supercontinent .
The earliest known supercontinent was called Rodina .
Scientists think that soon after this there was a time -LRB- the Cryogenian -RRB- when the Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets -LRB- glaciers -RRB- .
This is called the Snowball Earth theory .
Earth is a terrestrial planet .
This means it is made up of solid rock unlike a gas giant such as Jupiter .
It is the largest out of the four terrestrial planets in mass and diameter .
The Earth 's shape is an oblate spheroid .
This means it is basically a sphere but it bulges around the middle .
The circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 kilometers ; the average width of the Earth is about 12,700 km .
The highest point on Earth is the peak of Mount Everest at 8,848 m above sea level .
The lowest natural point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench at 10,911 meters below sea level .
Because of the bulge at the middle or the equator , the farthest point from the Earth 's center is the top of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador .
Inside , the Earth is similar to the other terrestrial planets .
It has an outer , solid rock layer called the crust .
Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust .
Below that is a layer of thick , semi-liquid rock called the mantle .
Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer core and then the solid iron inner core .
The thickness of the crust changes .
On land the average is between 30 â `` 50 kilometers thick .
Under the oceans in some places it is only 6 kilometers thick .
The inside of the Earth is very hot , the temperature of the outer core may be as high as 7000 Â .
The Earth is the only terrestrial planet with active plate tectonics .
Due to plate tectonics the Earth 's crust basically floats on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below .
The crust is split up into parts called plates .
These plates interact as they move about causing earthquakes and creating volcanoes and mountain ranges .
The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries .
There are three types of plate boundary : constructive , destructive and transform .
The Earth changes greatly from place to place .
Over 70 % of the Earth surface is covered by water .
The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with volcanos , mountains and trenches or canyons .
The 30 % not covered by water is mostly forests , deserts , plains , mountains and plateaux .
Human civilisation has led to increasing urbanisation â '' the growth of cities .
Many things can change the surface of the Earth .
Plate tectonics is main cause of change but there are others such as erosion from wind and rain , erosion by the oceans or meteorite impacts .
There are three main types of rock that make up the Earth 's surface :
All the water on Earth , on land or in the atmosphere , is part of the hydrosphere .
About 97.5 % of all water is salt water .
About half the fresh water is currently ice .
The oceans absorb or soak up carbon dioxide , a gas that adds to the greenhouse effect and global warming .
A planet 's atmosphere is a layer of different gases surrounding it .
It is kept there by gravity .
The Earth 's atmosphere is made of about 78 % nitrogen , 21 % oxygen and small amounts of other gases .
This mixture is often called air .
Further up there is a layer of ozone gas called the Ozone layer .
Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun .
Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to people , so without the Ozone layer life would not be possible .
The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with meteors and small asteroids .
This is because they burn up due to all the friction as they fly through it .
It also helps to keep Earth warm .
Some gases including carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket around the Earth , they trap heat under them , keeping the Earth warm .
This is called the natural greenhouse effect .
When humans build factories and power plants to make electricity , combustion is involved .
Combustion lets out a lot of carbon dioxide .
This carbon dioxide goes up into the atmosphere and traps more heat .
This is called global warming .
Hot air rises .
As it rises it gets colder again and falls .
This is called convection currents .
When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen .
Convection currents are the cause of almost all weather on Earth .
When it gets hot on the surface water evaporates and becomes steam or water vapor .
This hot water vapor rises .
As it rises it gets colder .
When it gets cold enough it turns back into water again .
This causes the clouds and rain .
It is called the water cycle .
The Earth takes about 24 hours to complete one day and about 365 days to complete a year .
Actually , the Earth take 365.24 days to revolve around the sun .
After every four years , an extra day is added , and the year has 366 days .
This is a leap year .
The Earth is , on average , 150 million kilometers away from the Sun , and moving at a speed of 30 kilometers a second or 108,000 miles an hour .
The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250,000 miles .
It is tidally locked to Earth , which means it always has the same side facing the Earth .
It takes roughly one month to complete one orbit .
The Earth is part of the Solar System and orbits the sun along with thousands of small objects and eight planets .
The Sun , and therefore the Solar System , are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and will be for approximately the next 10,000 years .
An experiment is a test of an idea invented by someone , usually a scientist .
An experiment is used to test a theoryâ '' to see how well the real world matches the theory .
Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them .
One important observation about experiments is that they can tell us if a theory is false .
They can not tell us if a theory is true .
For example , if we invent a theory that says All houses are made of wood , we can not say that it is true because all the houses we have seen are made of wood .
But , if we find a house that is not made of wood , we know that our theory is false .
Benjamin Franklin did a well known experiment by flying a kite during a thunderstorm .
He did the experiment to see if lightning was made of electricity .
Experiments are not the same as faith -LRB- belief -RRB- or other ways to find truth because experiments must have proof .
They begin by testing falsehood to find out truth .
`` The universe does not tell us when we are right , only when we are wrong . ''
â `` Karl Popper
Ethics is the part of philosophy that talks about good and evil .
Ethics tries to answer questions like :
Some philosophers call ethics the `` science of morality '' .
Morality is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad .
There are many different moralities , but they share some things .
For example most people think that murder -LRB- killing somebody -RRB- is wrong .
Some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share .
They think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad .
Their work can be used to test the fairness of a situation , such as how people should treat each other .
An example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative .
Many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness .
Other philosophers think that ethics is separate from morality .
They do not think that ethics can be studied using the scientific method and they think it is closer to metaphysics .
Some of them think like platonists about what is good and bad .
Another group of philosophers believe that ethics is subjective .
This means that they think that what is right for me is whatever I say is right .
This means that ethics is just a person 's own morality .
These philosophers do not think that ethics is the same for all people .
Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices .
Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics .
Ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways .
Here are some ways :
Along with Aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like .
Einstein on the Beach is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson .
It was first acted for an audience in Avignon , France in 1976 .
It is a single act opera , approximately five hours long with no intermission .
Given the minimalist -LRB- repetitive -RRB- nature of the music , audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish .
An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some way .
They may all have the same ancestors , speak the same language , or have the same religion .
Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group , but not always .
Often one country may have several different ethnic groups , or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries .
Ebola , pronounced E - Bo-la , is a hemorrhagic fever virus .
-LRB- Hemorrhagic means `` very heavy bleeding '' . -RRB-
It is a very deadly disease .
Out of every 10 people who get Ebola , on average five to nine die .
People who get infected with Ebola virus get the disease Ebola hemorrhagic fever .
In people , transmission -LRB- giving the virus to someone -RRB- happens because of touching fluids with the virus .
Ebola can not be caught through the air .
People with Ebola hemorrhagic -LRB- bleeding -RRB- fever bleed very much .
They have blood in diarrhea and vomit .
They bleed from their noses , mouths , and genitals .
These liquids are very infectious -LRB- they can make other people get the virus . -RRB-
When people get Ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases .
People get a fever , feel very tired , have headaches -LRB- pain in the head -RRB- , pain in the stomach , pain in their joints , and pain in the throat .
Sometimes people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever .
Later , people get much more sick .
They have very bad bleeding .
They get shock : low blood pressure , fast pulse -LRB- heart rate -RRB- , and low blood circulation to the body .
This causes their organs to get very sick .
The organs stop working .
This is called organ failure .
Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which leaves victims bedridden .
Even if they make it to a hospital , most die .
There is no special treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever .
But if people get care from doctors and nurses , more of them live .
This is called supportive care .
Supportive care can be fluids and blood given in people 's veins .
It can be medicines to make their blood pressure and blood circulation better .
When people get Ebola , it is called an outbreak .
If doctors see an outbreak is happening , they try to stop it .
They stop it by isolating people infected with the disease .
This means keeping the blood and fluids from people with Ebola from touching other people .
Then other people do not get the virus .
When an outbreak happens , many people come to try and help stop it .
The World Health Organization is the most important group that tries to stop Ebola outbreaks .
Scientists are trying to find a vaccine for Ebola .
Ecology is the science which studies the biota and the environment , and their interactions .
It comes from the Greek oikos = house ; logos = study .
Ecology is the study of ecosystems .
Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization .
Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity , ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earth 's atmosphere .
Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists .
Terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists -LRB- people studying ecology -RRB- now focus .
There are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology , wetland management , natural resource management -LRB- agriculture , forestry , fisheries -RRB- , city planning -LRB- urban ecology -RRB- , community health , economics , and applied science .
It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction .
Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement , wellness movement , environmental movement , and ecology movement we know today .
When these are combined with peace movements and the Six Principles , they are called green movements .
In general , these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities , as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony , and better economics .
People with these beliefs are called political ecologists .
Some have organized into the Green Parties , but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties .
They very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy , especially forest policy and energy policy .
Also , ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment , including other organisms .
Ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others , but it is difficult .
Many people think economics is just part of ecology now , and that economics that ignores it is wrong .
`` Natural capital '' is an example of one theory combining both .
Sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology , because both use a lot of methods to study one thing we can not live without .
Anthropology is about how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment , while ecology is about how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds .
There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology , which studies how people interact with the environment .
Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated : `` The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books .
Because it resists us .
Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle . ''
Economics is the study of how people make choices to get what they want , when they can not get everything they want .
The word comes from Ancient Greek , and relates to Î á 1\/4 Î Î Ï oÃ kos `` house '' and Î 1\/2 Ï Î 1\/4 Î Ï nomos `` custom '' or `` law '' .
The models used in economics today , were mostly started in the 19th century .
People took ideas from the field of political economy , because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences .
There are three main ideas that are useful for understanding economics .
Economics looks at how people try to make use of limited resources to get what they want .
Resources include money , time , and things -LRB- like shoes , clothes , toys , etc. -RRB- .
People want different resources than the ones they have , so they will trade resources for other resources .
Most resources are limited .
This is called scarcity .
Because things are scarce , people have to make choices about how to spend their resources on the different resources they want .
The study of this behavior can quickly become very complicated because there are many people , and each person 's choices affect the choices that other people make .
The subjects in economic study are households , business companies , the government -LRB- the state -RRB- , and foreign countries .
Households offer their `` factors of production '' to companies .
This includes work , land , capital -LRB- machines , buildings -RRB- and information .
They get income which they use to buy or ` consume ' goods .
Business companies produce and sell goods and buy factors of production from households and from other companies .
The state includes institutions and organizations .
The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households , and uses it to pay for `` public goods '' like streets or university education , to be available for everyone .
The last subject is foreign countries this includes all households , business companies and state institutions , which are not based in one 's own country .
They demand and supply goods from abroad .
The objects in economic study are consumer goods , capital goods , and factors of production .
Consumer goods are classified as `` usage goods '' -LRB- for example , toilet paper -RRB- , as `` purpose goods '' -LRB- for example , a car -RRB- , and as `` services '' -LRB- for example , the work of a cleaning lady -RRB- .
Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods .
Examples of these are buildings , equipment , and machines .
Factors of production are work , ground , capital , information , and environment .
Economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in .
For example , Karl Marx lived in a time where workers ' conditions were very poor , and John Maynard Keynes lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Today 's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgements , and try to make better ones .
The two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics .
Macroeconomics is about the economy in general .
For example , if a country 's wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed , those are things that macroeconomists study .
Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money .
Famous economists in our current society include N. Gregory Mankiw and Paul Krugman .
A chemical element is a substance that contains only one type of atom .
If a substance contains more than one type of atom , it is a compound .
An element can be a solid , liquid or gas .
The smallest particle of such an element is an atom .
Atoms are made up of protons , neutrons , and electrons .
Element contains only one kind of atom .
The number of protons in the atoms of an element is known as that element 's atomic number .
For example , all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are of the chemical element carbon , and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are of the element uranium .
118 different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry .
92 of these elements can be found in nature and the human body is made up of 26 elements .
The others can only be made in laboratories .
The last natural element discovered was uranium , in 1789 .
The first man-made element was Technetium , in 1937 .
All man-made elements are radioactive and unstable .
Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table .
Where the elemnts are in the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements .
Chemical elements are also given a unique chemical symbol .
Chemical symbols are used all over the world .
This means that , no matter which language is spoken , there is no confusion about what the symbol means .
Chemical symbols of elements come from their English or Latin names .
For example , carbon has the chemical symbol ` C ' , and sodium has chemical symbol ` Na ' , after the Latin natrium .
Tungsten is called ` W ' after its German name , wolfram .
` Au ' is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold , aurum .
Another symbol which comes from Latin is ` Ag ' .
This is the element silver and it comes from the Latin argentum .
Lead 's symbol , ` Pb ' , comes from the Latin plumbum and the English word plumber derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead .
Others were named after famous people , like einsteinium was named after Albert Einstein .
Elements can join -LRB- react -RRB- to form pure compounds -LRB- such as water , salts , oxides , and organic compounds -RRB- .
In many cases , these compounds have a fixed composition and their own structure and properties .
The properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from .
Sodium is a metal that burns when put into water and chlorine is a poisonous gas .
When they react together they make sodium chloride -LRB- salt -RRB- which is harmless and edible .
Some elements , particularly metal elements mix together in any proportion to form new structures .
Such new structures are not compounds .
They are called mixtures .
Atoms of the same element , whose nuclei contain a different number of neutrons , are said to be different isotopes of the element .
Elements can be classified based on physical states .
At room temperature and pressure , most elements are solids , only 11 are gases and 2 are liquids .
Elements can also be classified into metals and non-metals .
There are many more metals than non-metals .
However , a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals .
These elements are called semimetals -LRB- or metalloids -RRB- .
Egypt is a country in northeast Africa .
Its capital city is Cairo .
Egypt is famous for its very old monuments , such as the Pyramids and the Sphinx .
Egypt has been an independent country since 1922 .
It is a member of the United Nations and the Arab League .
It was a republic from 1952 after the revolution of 1952 by the leader Gamal Abd Alnaasar
Egypt is a large country , but a large portion of it is desert .
Most people live in areas around the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Nile River .
This includes the cities of Cairo , Alexandria , Aswan , and Port Said .
Not many people live in the desert .
Today , Egypt has about 80 million people .
Egypt is divided into 29 areas , called Governorates of Egypt .
The Egyptian Parliament sits in Cairo and makes laws for the whole country .
As of February 11 , 2011 , the country is being run by the military .
In January 2011 , thousands of protesters gathered in Cairo .
They wanted Hosni Mubarak to leave office .
He had been the President for last 30 years .
On February 11 , Vice President Omar Suleiman made an announcement .
He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office .
Suleiman also said that Mubarak directed the Supreme Council of the armed forces would run the country .
Today , the people of Egypt are mostly Sunni Muslims .
There are still some Christians in Egypt today .
Many of these belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria .
Many famous people are from Egypt .
Some of these include Omar Sharif , who was an international actor , Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was the first person from Africa to lead the United Nations , and four Nobel Prize winners : Anwar Sadat , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 , Naguib Mahfouz , who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988 , Ahmed Zewail , who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999 , and Mohamed ElBaradei , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 .
Egypt 's climate is good in winter and very hot in summer , depending on the time .
Everything2 or E2 is a website .
It lets people make pages about many different things , and some people use it as a diary .
E2 users create pages called nodes and add stuff in writeups .
Only logged-in users can create writeups .
Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners -LRB- called `` gods '' -RRB- choose can edit the writeup .
On the other hand , on Wikipedia , anyone can edit pages , but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages .
Everything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does .
So , it is possible to have more than one article -LRB- writeups -RRB- under the same title -LRB- node -RRB- , each by different authors , and presenting different points of view .
Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem .
It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year , within a given patch of forest .
However , the concept is also applicable to water , and soil , and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources .
The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is `` renewed '' -LRB- refreshed or regrown or rebuilt -RRB- .
Nature 's services analysis calculates the global yield of the Earth 's biosphere to humans as a whole .
This is said to be greater in size than the entire human economy .
However , it is more than just yield , but also the natural processes that increase biodiversity and conserve habitat which result in the total value of these services .
`` Yield '' of ecological commodities like wood or water , useful to humans , is only a part of it .
Very often an ecological yield in one place offsets an ecological load in another .
Greenhouse gas released in one place , for instance , is fairly evenly distributed in the atmosphere , and so greenhouse gas control can be achieved by creating a carbon sink literally anywhere else .
Ecocide is thought by some green economists to be accelerated by debt instruments which demand a yield -LRB- economics -RRB- greater than the ecological capacity to renew .
This is a major question in monetary reform .
February is the second month of the year with 28 days in most years .
In leap years February has 29 days .
In Sweden in 1732 the month had 30 days .
This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world .
In 1930 and 1931 , February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long .
The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from `` februa '' , the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month .
February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar -LRB- the other is January -RRB- .
This is because in the original Roman calendar , the two months of winter , when not much would happen in agriculture , did not have names .
From circa 700 BC , when Numa Pompilius , the second king of Rome , added it to the calendar , February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year , until 46 BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise .
February 's flower is the violet and its birthstone is the amethyst .
The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity .
This is a list of annual events or festivals .
FAQ is an abbreviation for `` Frequently Asked Question -LRB- s -RRB- '' .
The term is used for a list questions and answers .
All of the questions are supposed to be asked often and they all are about the same thing .
Since the acronym was first used in written form , there are different ways it is said ; both `` fak '' and `` F.A.Q. '' are commonly used .
Financial capital is a form of capital .
It is things that have value , but do not do anything by themselves .
They are only valuable because people value -LRB- want -RRB- them .
For example , money is a form of financial capital .
You can not do anything with money but it still has value .
Financial capital is used to pay for things , this is because there is always more of it and people always want it .
This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people .
Some forms of financial capital , such as stocks , gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody .
However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital .
Because of this , these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price .
This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market .
Some things are treated as financial capital , even though they do have a use .
For example , some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it .
Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money .
Other types of capital , such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital .
This may be because they involve people .
Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification .
In politics , a common question is how often the government should use financial capital .
In particular , should the government use financial capital to make a profit ?
Traditionally , liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit , but socialist or conservative politicians are against it .
Food is material that comes from animals or plants , eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition .
Food contains the nutrition that people need to be healthy .
People need to eat protein , fat , carbohydrates , vitamins , and minerals to be healthy .
Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called `` drinks '' .
Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening , and includes animal and vegetable sources .
Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin , like meat , eggs and products with milk in them .
Not eating meat is called vegetarianism .
Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism .
Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be transformed by industrial processes -LRB- the food industry -RRB- .
Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives -LRB- such as preservative , antioxidants , emulsifiers , flavor enhancers , etc. -RRB- .
At home , food is prepared in the kitchen , by the cook .
The cook sometimes uses a cookbook .
Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cooker , pot , and pan .
Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants -LRB- often workers , or in the evening for entertainment -RRB- or refectory -LRB- in particular for kids in school -RRB- .
The utensils used may be a plate , knife , fork , chopsticks , spoon , bowl , or spork .
Most people do not grow their own food , so they have to buy food that was grown by someone else .
People buy most of their food in stores , shops , or markets .
But some people still grow most or all of their own food .
People may buy food and take it home to cook it , or buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor , or in a restaurant .
Food shortage is still a big problem in the world today .
Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need .
Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world .
When people do not have enough food , we say that they are hungry .
If they do not eat enough food for a long time , they will become sick and die from starvation .
In areas where many people do not have enough food , we say that there is famine there .
Food can make people sick if it is contaminated by micro-organisms , heavy metals , or chemicals .
If people do not eat the right foods , they can become sick .
If people do not eat enough protein , they get the disease called kwashiorkor .
If they do not eat enough vitamin B1 -LRB- thiamine -RRB- , they get the disease called beriberi .
If people eat too much food , they can become overweight or obese .
This is also bad for people 's health .
Many cultures or religions have food taboos .
That means they have rules what people should not eat , or how the food has to be prepared .
Examples of religious food rules are the Kashrut of Judaism and the Halal of Islam , that say that pig meat can not be eaten .
In Hinduism , beef is not allowed to be eaten .
To fry food is to cook it in hot butter or vegetable oil .
We can fry food in a small amount of butter or oil in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot .
Some restaurants also have large deep fryers to fry a lot of food at once .
A fish -LRB- plural : fish or fishes -RRB- is a class of vertebrates that live in water .
They are covered with scales , and have two sets of paired fins , and several unpaired fins .
They are usually cold-blooded .
A fish takes in the oxygen from the water using gills .
There are many different kinds of fish .
They live in fresh water in lakes and rivers , and in salt water in the ocean .
Some fish are less than one centimeter long .
The largest fish is the whale shark , which can be almost 15 meters long and weigh 15 tons .
Certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish : Crayfish are crustaceans , and jellyfish are Cnidarians .
Fish , the oldest vertebrate group , includes a huge range of types , from the Middle Ordovician , about 490 million years ago , to the present day .
These are the main groups :
Most kinds of fish have bones .
Some kinds of fish , such as sharks and rays , do not have real bones -LRB- their skeletons are made of cartilage -RRB- they are known as cartilagenous fish .
All fish are covered with overlapping scales , and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale .
Teleosts -LRB- ` modern ' fish -RRB- have what are called leptoid scales .
These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles .
Sharks and other chondrichthyes have placoid scales made of denticles , like small versions of their teeth .
These also overlap in a head to tail direction , producing a tough outer layer .
Shark skin is available for purchase as shagreen , a leather which as original is smooth in one direction , and rough in the other direction .
It may be polished for use , but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping .
The scales are usually covered with a layer of slime which improves passage through the water , and makes the fish more slippery to a predator .
Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water .
There are exceptions , but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail , generally getting larger as they go along .
Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body & tail fin -LRB- caudal fin -RRB- .
However , there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins .
The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example .
But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies & caudal fins .
The shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming .
This is because streamlined body shapes makes the water drag less .
Here are some common fish shapes .
The picture on the left shows a shark .
This shark 's shape is called fusiform , and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy .
This is the best shape for going through water quickly .
Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly .
Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly , like marlins , swordfish , and tuna .
Ichthyosaurs , porpoises , dolphins , killer whales all have similar shapes .
This is an example of convergent evolution .
The long , ribbon-like shape of an eel 's body shows another shape .
This enables them to hide in cracks , springing out quickly to capture prey , then returning quickly to their hiding spot .
Flatfish live on the bottom of the ocean or lake .
Most use camouflage : they change colors to match the ocean floor .
Fish with compressed shapes have flat , vertical bodies , with one eye on each side .
They swim upright and can be very thin .
They usually live in reefs where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the corals , sponges , and rocks , keeping hidden from predators .
Angelfish , surgeonfish , and butterflyfish are all compressed fish .
People eat many kinds of fish .
The fish that people eat most include carp , cod , herring , perch , sardines , sturgeon , tilapia , trout , tuna , and many others .
Some people keep fish as pets .
Goldfish and Siamese Fighting Fish are popular types of pet fish .
They are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature .
See also : Fishing The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish .
People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats , or with big nets from big boats .
People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait .
This is often called fishing .
There is also different types of lures that can be used .
One is a crank bait .
Others are plastic worms and rat-l-traps .
These are lots of different ways of catching fish .
Foot is also the name of a unit of measurement .
See foot -LRB- unit of length -RRB- .
A foot -LRB- one foot , two or more feet -RRB- is a body part on the end of a leg .
We use it when walking , and it is important for balance : it helps us stand straight .
We also use it to kick , in both fighting and sports , football being an example .
People 's hands and feet have the same shape : they both have five digits -LRB- the fingers and toes -RRB- .
Many other animals with backbones also have five digits .
The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the heel .
The bottom of the foot is called the sole .
Half the bones in our body are in the foot .
Doctors who work with people 's feet are podiatrists or chiropodists .
Animals often have feet , and there are a lot of different sorts of foot .
When an animal has soft feet , or feet with soft parts on the underside , we often call it a paw .
In many societies , people like to cover the foot when they are with others , especially outside .
In many cultures -LRB- for example North American , European , Japanese and others -RRB- people wear clothing over the foot to keep it safe .
This footwear has special names , for example sandals , shoes , and boots .
When people always wear footwear , especially in hot places or when they are very active , their feet can smell badly -LRB- foot odour -RRB- .
If footwear is too big or small , it can be bad for the feet when the person wears the shoe because it can cause long term damage .
People who have foot , leg , and back problems can also get help from special shoes .
People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear .
For example , in much of Europe and Canada , people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting .
In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home .
In Japan , people do not wear shoes , and floors are often made of very soft materials , too soft for shoes .
In cultures where people always wear shoes , people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them .
Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet , especially for children 's feet .
Conditions like Athlete 's foot affect the feet , causing the feet to feel dry and cracked .

French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe , and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world .
The roots of modern haute cuisine lie in chefs like La Varenne -LRB- 1615 â `` 1678 -RRB- and the notable chef of Napoleon , Marie-Antoine CarÃ me -LRB- 1784 â `` 1833 -RRB- .
These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the middle ages .
They used fewer spices , and more herbs and creamy ingredients .
Typical ingredients like roux and fish stock , and techniques such as marinading , and dishes such as ragout , were invented .
CarÃ me was an expert pÃ cents tissier -LRB- pastry-maker -RRB- , and this is still a mark of French cooking .
He developed basic sauces , his ` mother sauces ' ; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire , based on the half-dozen mother sauces .
French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier -LRB- 1846 â `` 1935 -RRB- .
He was a genius at organization .
He worked out how to run large restaurants , as in a big hotel or a palace ; how the staff should be organised ; how the menu was prepared .
He had methods for everything .
Escoffier 's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903 , which established the fundamentals of French cookery .
Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London , the HÃ tel Ritz Paris , and some of the greatest cruise ships .
Escoffier , however , left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France .
Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century .

It is known for sure that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the Iron Age .
-LRB- The Iron Age was in Finland 2500-800 years ago -RRB- .
The first residents in Finland hunted animals , instead of farming their food .
Those kind of people are called `` hunter-gatherers '' .
Some people started the farm to farm some food 5200 years ago .
Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age .
The religion of the Finnish people was paganism .
The biggest god of the Finns was Ukko .
He was a god of sky and thunder .
About a thousand years ago some Finns changed their religion to Christianity , and slowly Christianity became more and more popular .
Some pagan beliefs still remained amongst the Christian beliefs .

From the Middle Ages Finland was a part of Sweden .
Then , in the year 1809 AD Russia took Finland from Sweden .
Finland was a part of Russia , but after a short period of time it became autonomous , which means that the Finns essentially controlled Finland , though Stalin was in control officially .
Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency , -LRB- called the markka -RRB- , their own stamps and own customs .
However , Finland did not have its own army .
On 6 December 1917 , Finland became independent , which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia .
There was a communist revolution in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the Soviet Union .
There were communists in Finland too , who tried to create a revolution in Finland .
This attempt at revolution caused the Finnish civil war .
The communists lost the civil war , and Finland did not change its old capitalist system .
Stalin , who was the leader of the Soviet Union , did not like having a capitalist country as its neighbor .
Stalin wanted Finland to become a communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union .
The leaders of Finland refused : they wanted to stay independent .
The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them , which resulted in the Winter War .
There were many battles , that eventually resulted in Finland losing areas along its eastern border to the Soviet Union .
Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany , and wanted to invade the Soviet Union .
Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost , so they joined the German invasion , which started in 1941 .
This part of the Second World War is called the Continuation War in Finland .
However , Finland was not a fascist or an antisemitic country .
Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship .
While Germany was losing the war , Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace .
Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union , which resulted in peace , but once again Finland had to relinquish the areas that they had conquered .
This time , the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies .
Finns fought Germans , and Germans retreated to Norway , burning down the whole of Lapland behind them .

In a shop , a fruit is any fleshy , sweet plant growth .
In botany , a fruit is a plant structure that contains its seeds .
The word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary .
It is an extra layer round the seeds , which may or may not be fleshy .
However , even in botany , there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified .
Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower .
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in flowers , only flowering plants produce fruits .
Fruits are an evolutionary ` invention ' which help seeds get dispersed by animals .
The botanical term includes many that are not `` fruits '' in the common sense of the term .
such as the vegetables squash , pumpkins , cucumbers , tomato , peas , beans , corn , eggplant , and sweet pepper and some spices , such as allspice and chillies .
An accessory fruit or false fruit -LRB- pseudocarp -RRB- is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue .
A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium .
Pomes , such as apples and pears , are also accessory fruits : the core is the true fruit .
Many fruits come from trees or bushes .
For plants , fruits are a means of dispersal , usually by animals .
When the fruit breaks apart , the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow .
Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water and natural sugars , and many are high in Vitamin C. They have a large amount of dietary fiber .
Fruits are usually low in protein and fat content , but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this .
Not only humans , but our closest living relatives -LRB- primates -RRB- are keen fruit-eaters .
So are many other groups of herbivorous mammals and many birds .
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce .
Commercial bananas and pineapple are examples of seedless fruits .
Some citrus fruits , especially oranges , satsumas , mandarin oranges , table grapes , grapefruit , and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness .
Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids , and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant which is produced by fertilisation .
The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation .
A farm is a piece of land used to grow plants and\/or raise animals for food .
People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers .
This type of work is called farming .
Land that is used to grow plants for food , or could be used to grow plants for food is called arable land .
A life raising animals for food is called a pastoral life .
Many farms in richer countries are very large and can cause damage to the world we live in .
Geography is the study of the Earth and its features , its inhabitants , and its phenomena .
The word geography comes from the Greek words gÃ -LRB- `` Earth '' -RRB- and graphein -LRB- `` to write '' -RRB- .
It means `` to write about the Earth '' .
The word was first used by a scientist called Eratosthenes -LRB- 276-194 B.C. -RRB- .
Its features are things like continents , seas , rivers and mountains .
Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it .
Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides , winds , and earthquakes .
A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer .
A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it , how they started and how they have changed .
Geography is not the same as ecology .
A geographer tries to describe how things are , while an ecologist thinks about changes that might happen in the future .
Ecologists need the work of geographers so that they can work out the future .
Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography .
Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment .
The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country , how a country 's economy is doing , and more .
Geographers need to know a lot about maps because maps are very important for understanding geography .
Geographers use maps a lot , and often make them .
Making maps is called cartography , and similarly , people who make maps are cartographers .
Grammar means the rules about how to speak and write in a language .
The Ancient Greeks used to call it grammatikÄ `` tÃ khnÄ `` , the craft of letters .
It can have any of these meanings :
When we speak , we use the native-person 's grammar , or as near as we can .
When we write , we try to write with correct usage grammar .
So , speaking and writing a language each have their own style .
All languages have their own grammar .
Most European languages are rather similar whereas , for example , Chinese and Japanese are very different from all European languages .
Nevertheless , English has its own quite special characteristics .
English makes few changes to its word endings -LRB- ` suffixes ' -RRB- .
In the Italic or ` Romance ' languages -LRB- such as French , Italian , Spanish -RRB- , word endings carry a lot of meaning .
In English we have just a few : plurals and posessives -LRB- John 's -RRB- are the most common .
In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one : I love , you love , but she loves .
That final 's ' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon , which had more suffixes .
Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense : walked , walking .
Word order is the other big difference .
All Romance languages normally put their adjectives in front of the nouns .
For example , in English , a person may say I like fast cars , but in Spanish , it is Me gustan los coches rÃ pidos .
The order of the words has changed : if just the words , without the grammar , are translated into English , it would mean ` to me they please the cars fast ' .
This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order .
In German , main verbs often come near the end of sentences , whereas in English we usually put them between subject and object , as : the cat sat on the mat .
Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more fluid .
Sentences English speakers find normal today might have seemed strange to people 100 years ago .
And they might not , because many of our favorite sayings come from the Authorized King James Version of the Bible , and from Shakespeare .
Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking .
For example , people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say , I did n't do anything , while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English or AAVE might say , I did n't do nothing .
London working class version : I ai n't done nuffink !
These are called double negatives , and are found almost entirely in spoken language , not written language .
These differences are called dialects .
The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live .
Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order , they still have grammar rules .
However , when writing in American English , grammar uses the rules of General American English .
When people talk about using ` proper English ' , they usually mean using the grammar of general British English , as described in standard reference works .
The models for spoken English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English .
Grammar studies nouns , pronouns , verbs , adjectives , adverbs , prepositions , conjunctions , sentences , phrases , clauses , syntax .
The Great Lakes are five very big lakes in eastern North America .
They are , in fact , the biggest fresh water lakes in the world -LRB- freshwater is water that is not salty like the ocean -RRB- .
Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between Canada and the United States of America .
The other , Lake Michigan , is entirely inside the United States .
Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron ; then through the Detroit River into Lake Erie ; then through Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario ; and then through the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean .
The GNU Free Documentation License -LRB- GFDL -RRB- is a copyleft license for open content .
It was made up by the Free Software Foundation -LRB- FSF -RRB- for the GNU project .
It was initially created for use with software documentation , but can be applied to other types of works as well , such as Wikipedia .
As a copyright license , the GFDL is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work -LRB- such as a book , an encyclopedia article , a painting , or a piece of music -RRB- and anyone else who might want to use it .
The GFDL is considered `` copyleft '' because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work , not to restrict its use .
If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL , the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce , distribute , or modify the work , as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL .
Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDLâ '' that is , once something is licensed as GFDL , it will always stay licensed as GFDL , and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL .
-LRB- Because the license `` reproduces '' and stays with the work , this is sometimes called a `` viral '' license . -RRB-
The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL , the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work , and include a list of changes they made to the work .
Finally , any work licensed with the GFDL must contain , somewhere , the entire text of the license .
This provision has been criticized , because it is not always easy to include an entire , long license with a copyrighted work .
In a book , for example , it is easy to include one extra page with the license , but if the work is something like a song , or a photograph , it is not easy .
The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated .
For example , if part of the work is labeled as an `` invariant section , '' it can not ever be removed or changed by someone using the work -LRB- `` invariant '' means `` does not change '' -RRB- .
Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL .
For example , in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it .
But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not , so this would not be allowed .
Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially copyright infringement .
A number of online projects use the GFDL .
The largest online project to license its content under the GFDL is Wikipedia .
The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used .
Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses , that it is not always clear and easy to understand , and that some of its requirements , such as the `` invariant sections '' , are not free at all .
So the choice is up to you if you agree with it .
Glass is a hard material that can be made in many shapes .
It is usually transparent , but it can also be made in colors .
Glass is made of sand that is heated until it is liquid .
When it is liquid , it is shaped and left to cool .
Glass is often used to make windows and bottles .
Many churches have windows made of colored glass .
The word `` glass '' can also refer to a drink container .
It does not have to be made of glass , but can be made of any material , for example plastic .
Glass is used to make lenses .
The word `` glasses '' is often used to mean eyeglasses .
The myth that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches -LRB- 2-300 years old -RRB- are sometimes a little out of shape : thicker at the bottom than the top .
This phenomenon is actually due to the process of glass manufacture in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other .
It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom .
Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window .
Some religions say that there is a supernatural being called God .
Other religions say there is more than one god .
A supernatural being is also sometimes called a deity .
Many religions believe that a deity created everything that exists .
In most religions , a god is believed to be immortal -LRB- can not die -RRB- , and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans .
The belief that there is at least one god is usually called theism .
People who reject belief that any deities exist are called atheists .
Agnostics think we can not know for sure whether any deities exist , but still might -LRB- or might not -RRB- believe at least one deity exists .
In some religions there are many gods , which is called polytheism .
In other religions , there is only one , which is called monotheism .
In polytheism the word `` gods '' is usually written in lowercase letters .
God is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist .
Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god .
Many people have asked themselves if God exists .
Philosophers , theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists , others have tried to show that it does not exist .
In philosophical terminology , such arguments are about the epistemology of the ontology of God .
Science has found no evidence that indicates the existence of God or of anything supernatural .
The debate exists mainly in philosophy since scientists can not really prove whether or not supernatural things like gods exist .
There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God .
Some definitions of God are not specific , others sometimes contradict themselves .
Arguments for the existence of God typically include metaphysical , empirical , inductive , and subjective types .
Some theories are built around holes in evolutionary theory , as well as order and complexity in the world .
Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical , deductive , and inductive arguments .
Conclusions sometimes include : `` God does not exist '' -LRB- strong atheism -RRB- ; `` God almost certainly does not exist '' -LRB- de facto atheism -RRB- ; `` no one knows whether God exists '' -LRB- agnosticism -RRB- ; `` God exists , but this can not be proven or disproven '' -LRB- deism or theism -RRB- ; and `` God exists and this can be proven '' -LRB- theism -RRB- .
There are many variations on these positions , and sometimes different names for some of them .
For example , the position `` God exists and this can be proven '' is sometimes called `` gnostic theism '' or `` strong theism '' .
In the year 2000 , approximately 53 % of the world 's population felt part of one of the three main Abrahamic religions -LRB- 33 % Christian , 20 % Islam , less than 1 % Judaism -RRB- , 6 % with Buddhism , 13 % with Hinduism , 6 % with traditional Chinese religion , 7 % with various other religions , and less than 15 % as non-religious .
Most of these religious beliefs involve a god or gods .
Abrahamic religions are very popular monotheistic ones .
Well-known Abrahamic religions include Judaism , Christianity , and Islam .
Monotheistic means the people in these religions believe there is only one god .
The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in Judaism , but some Jews today call him YHWH -LRB- Yahweh -RRB- or Jehovah .
Muslims say the word Allah , which is the Arabic word for `` The God . ''
Believers in the Abrahamic religions believe that the Abrahamic God has created human beings in his image , but this idea is rarely taken literally .
The idea of an old man with a beard has been used in art since the Renaissance , but is not what most monotheists actually believe he looks like .
The Christian Bible talks about God in different ways .
Christians say that the Old Testament talks about `` God the Father '' .
The New Testament is about Jesus , or `` God the Son '' .
Many Christians also believe that Jesus was God 's incarnation on earth .
Christians consider the Holy Spirit to be God as well .
In early times , Christians tried to solve this problem .
In the New Testament , there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms : the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit -LRB- also known as the Holy Ghost -RRB- .
This is called the Holy Trinity by most people who believe in it , although the word `` Trinity '' is not in the Bible .
Another word that most Christians believe means the same thing as `` Trinity '' is `` Godhead '' .
Some Christians do not believe in the Trinity .
Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God and taught people about God .
Members of the Unitarian Church have these beliefs .
Christians believe that God became a man named Jesus , and came to Earth to save everyone from sin .
When Jesus prayed and talked to God , he called him `` Father , '' and taught others to do the same .
In Hinduism , there is only one God , named Brahman , but Brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations .
Some of these are Rama , Krishna , Buddha , Shiva , Kali , Parvati , and Durga .
To many outsiders , the worship of God 's different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods .
However , it is really only the worship of one God in different ways .
Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone .
This idea is called Advaita Vedanta , which is the Hindu term for Monism .
Religions like Buddhism and Confucianism involve the worship of many gods , or sometimes no gods at all .
Philosophers can talk about God or god ; sometimes they talk about a specific god , but other times they are just talking about the idea of god .
One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the Greek Aristotle , who describes god as the Supreme Cause .
Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen , but is not influenced by anything else .
There are also some philosophical problems with God .
One of them is called God paradox .
It is a question about whether -LRB- an omnipotent -RRB- God can make a mountain that is so heavy he can not lift it .
A ghost is considered to be the spirit of a dead person .
Scientists say that there are no real ghosts , but many people believe that there are .
There are many stories about ghosts in books and movies .
Sometimes the ghost is the spirit of a person who was killed by enemies or who died in a scary way .
The ghost may stay on Earth because he or she is angry due to some problem in life and wants to scare people or to harm his or her enemies .
Sometimes ghosts are said to live in a particular locality , for example an abandoned house , and when occupants come they tease them to drive away or cause serious damage to the occupants .
Sometimes the ghosts in these stories exist because of some problem the person had during life , that was not solved before he or she died .
The ghost stays on the Earth trying to fix the problem .
If the problem is fixed , the ghost can leave the Earth .
Many ghosts stay on Earth also because they have died younger or have had sudden or abrupt deaths .
Many people claim to have seen or heard ghosts .
People who try to talk to ghosts as their job are called Mediums .
Many people believe they have seen ghosts .
Others believe they have felt ghosts near them .
Often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of cold and a light or a misty cloud , but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people .
Sometimes ghosts are said to come in human form , that is , in the body of a person .
Some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them , by being seen suddenly .
Some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who are in problems .
The ghost might also appear as they did at the time of their death , including any blood or injuries .
Ghosts can also appear and disappear as they wish .
Many ghosts haunt the place they have died or a living loved one .
Some may seek revenge or stay simply because they are confused .
Ghosts can form right after they die , or even centuries later .
Many people make up stories or urban legends .
many try to prove the existence of these paranormal creatures with special technology such as heat sensors .
They also make TV shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts , often investigating cases where a person has seen one or visiting a place of sighting .
Green is a color .
It is one of the colors of the rainbow .
Green is between the yellow and blue colors in a rainbow .
Green paint can be made by mixing yellow paint and blue paint together .
Green light , like all light , is formed from waves .
In its wave , the distance between the smallest repeating parts -LRB- the wavelength -RRB- is about 550 nanometers -LRB- one-billionth of a meter -RRB- .
Most leaves of growing plants , such as trees and bushes , are green .
This is because there is a chemical in leaves , called chlorophyll , which is colored green .
Green is a color , the perception of which is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by range with a wavelength of roughly 570-520 nm .

Google is one of the biggest and most famous websites for finding things -LRB- search engine -RRB- on the World Wide Web -LRB- WWW -RRB- .
They also do other things than searching .
Other search engines -LRB- for example , AOL -RRB- use its software and information -LRB- database -RRB- too .
That makes it the most-used search engine on the web .
Every day , 200 million -LRB- 200,000,000 -RRB- people use it .
Google 's main office -LRB- `` Googleplex '' -RRB- is in Mountain View , California , USA .
With Google , people can also search for pictures , Usenet newsgroups , news , and things to buy online .
By June 2004 , Google had 4.28 billion web pages on its database , 880 million -LRB- 880,000,000 -RRB- pictures and 845 million -LRB- 845,000,000 -RRB- Usenet messages â '' six billion things .
`` To google , '' as an action word -LRB- verb -RRB- means `` to search for something on Google '' .
Because Google is so popular -LRB- over 50 % of web users use it -RRB- it has been used to mean `` to search the web '' .
Google dislikes this use since the name of the company is a trademark .
Google can lose that trademark if people use it too widely .
Google was started in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin , two students at Stanford University , USA .
It used to be called Backrub .
Later , they made it into a company , Google Inc. , on September 7 , 1998 at a friend 's garage in Menlo Park , California .
In February 1999 , the company moved to 165 University Ave. , Palo Alto , California .
Then , later that year , it moved to another place , now called the `` Googleplex '' .
In September 2001 , Google 's rating system -LRB- `` PageRank '' , for saying which information is more helpful -RRB- got a U.S. Patent .
The patent was to Stanford University , with Lawrence -LRB- Larry -RRB- Page as the inventor -LRB- the person who first had the idea -RRB- .
Google makes an important , though shrinking , percentage of its money through its friends like America Online and InterActiveCorp .
It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization -LRB- PSO -RRB- which helps make contracts , helps making accounts better , and gives engineering help .
The name `` Google '' is a misspelling of the word googol .
Milton Sirotta , nephew of U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner , made this word in 1938 , for the number 1 and one hundred 0 's .
It is said that the word `` googol '' was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk .
Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use .
Andy Bechtolsheim first thought of the name .
-LRB- 1 googol is 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 , 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 . -RRB-
The name for Google 's main office , the `` Googleplex , '' is a play on a different , even bigger number , the `` googolplex '' , which is 1 with 1 googol of 0 's .
A gallon is a unit of measurement used to measure volume .
People have used many different gallons throughout history .
There are three types of gallon still in use .
A government is a group of people that has the power to rule in a territory , according to the law .
This territory may be a country , a state or province within a country , or a region .
The simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land .
This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a village or as big as a continent -LRB- like Australia and India -RRB- .
Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it .
It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe .
Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission .
This view is called libertarianism .
Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in peace , without government .
This view is called anarchism .
Almost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government .
Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules , small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica , because almost no people live there .
For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims sovereign control over it .
The word `` sovereign '' is old and means `` control by a King '' -LRB- sovereign -RRB- .
Governments of villages , cities , counties and other communities are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist , and then to that of the country .
It is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation-states came .
The capital of a country , for instance , is where the King kept his assets .
From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics .
A government is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land .
Governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish .
In very many countries , there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs that are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them .
Tax is how government is paid for in most countries .
People who buy , sell , import , invest , own a house or land , or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government .
There are many theories of how to organize government better .
These are called theories of civics .
Because government is run by people who can be greedy , many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy .
That way , if government does not act nice , they can be replaced in the next election .
Still many countries ' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power .
There are many theories of how to run a government better , and keep people from hurting each other .
These theories are part of politics .
No matter how a government is chosen , it must do politics to keep power .
For the automobile , see Ford Galaxy .
A galaxy is a group of many stars , along with gas , dust , and dark matter .
Gravity holds galaxies together .
Everything in a galaxy moves around a center .
The name galaxy is taken from the Greek word Galaxia meaning milky , a reference to our own galaxy , the Milky Way .
There are three main types of galaxies : ellipticals , spirals , and irregulars .
All galaxies exist inside the universe .
There are probably over 170 billion -LRB- 1.7 x1011 -RRB- galaxies within distance we can see or the observable universe .
There are galaxies of different sizes .
Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million -LRB- 107 -RRB- stars up to giants with a hundred trillion -LRB- 1014 -RRB- stars , all orbiting the galaxy 's center of mass. .
Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems , star clusters , and various interstellar clouds .
The Sun is one of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy ; the Solar System includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun .
Star clusters are not galaxies , they are inside galaxies .
Globular clusters are spherical tightly knit balls of stars which are part of the outer halo of the Milky Way .
One of the largest -LRB- and oldest -RRB- known star clusters , Messier 15 , has several million stars , packed closely together , with a black hole at its center .
The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count , but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies .
In addition to the overall expansion of the universe , galaxies move relative to other galaxies .
They can and do collide .
When this happens , the stars generally move past each other , but gas clouds and dust interact , and can form a burst of new stars .
Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes , formng bars , rings or tail-like structures .
Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars .
The Milky Way , and all spiral shaped galaxies like it -LRB- see above image of NGC 2997 -RRB- , produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year .
These stars are formed in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1 % to 10 % of the mass of these galaxies .
Globular star clusters , on the other hand , are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up .
In the astronomical literature , the word ` Galaxy ' with a capital G is used for our galaxy , the Milky Way .
The billions of other galaxies are just written as ` galaxy ' with a lowercase g. The term Milky Way first came out in the English language in a poem by Chaucer .
-LCB- -LCB- Quote `` See yonder , lo , the GalaxyÃ `` Which men clepeth the Milky Wey , For hit is whyt '' .
When William Herschel wrote his catalog of deep sky objects , he used the name spiral nebula for objects like the Andromeda Galaxy , but nebula is now only used for diffuse structures within a galaxy .
In Greek mythology , Zeus places his son -LRB- the baby Heracles -RRB- whose mother was a mortal woman on Hera 's breast while she is sleeping so that the baby will drink her divine milk and become immortal .
However , Hera wakes up while she is breastfeeding the baby and realizes she is nursing a baby she does not know .
According to Greek mythology , she then pushes the baby away and a stream of her milk sprays the night sky , making a faint band of light known as the Milky Way .
Geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size , shapes , and positions of things .
There are flat shapes and solid shapes in geometry .
Squares , circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry .
Cubes , cylinders , cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry .
Geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape .
It can also be used to measure a solid shape 's volume and surface area .
Geometry can be used to measure many things by seeing them as made of geometrical shapes .
For example , geometry can help people find :
Geometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people .
It means to measure the land .
It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics .
The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry .
Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true , called axioms .
Such as :
Graph theory is a field of mathematics about graphs .
A graph is an abstract representation : A number of points are connected by lines .
Each point is usually called a vertex -LRB- more than one are called vertices -RRB- , and the lines are called edges .
Graphs are a tool for modelling .
They are used to find answers to a number of problems .
Leonhard Euler used to live in a city that was called KÃ nigberg for some time .
-LRB- The city has been called Kaliningrad since 1946 -RRB- .
The city is situated on the river Pregel .
There is an island in the river , and there are a number of bridges across the river .
Euler loved to go for walks , so he asked himself , whether it was possible to do a walk , use each of the bridges once , and come back to the point where he started .
In 1736 , he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible .
Today , this problem is known as the Seven Bridges of KÃ nigsberg .
The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory .
This article , as well as the one written by Vandermonde on the knight problem , carried on with the analysis situs initiated by Leibniz .
Euler 's formula was about the number of edges , vertices , and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by Cauchy and L'Huillier , and is at the origin of topology .
Over a century after Euler , Cayley studied a special class of graphs , called the trees .
A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices .
Cayley tried to solve a problem from differential calculus .
His solution influenced the development of theoretical chemistry .
The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties .
Today , this is called Enumerative graph theory .
It developed from Cayleys results , a scientific publication done by PÃ lya between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by De Bruijn in 1959 .
Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition .
The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory .
In particular , the term `` graph '' was introduced by Sylvester in an article published in 1878 in Nature .
One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the four color problem : `` Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors , in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors ? ''
This problem was first posed by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of De Morgan addressed to Hamilton the same year .
Many incorrect proofs have been proposed , including those by Cayley , Kempe , and others .
The study and the generalization of this problem by Tait , Heawood , Ramsey and Hadwiger led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary genus .
Tait 's reformulation generated a new class of problems , the factorization problems , particularly studied by Petersen and KÅ ` nig .
The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by TurÃ n in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory , extremal graph theory .
The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century .
A proof produced in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken , which involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer , was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity .
A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by Robertson , Seymour , Sanders and Thomas .
The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of Jordan , Kuratowski and Whitney .
Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra .
The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff , who published in 1845 his Kirchhoff 's circuit laws for calculating the voltage and current in electric circuits .
Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science .
To many such problems , exact solutions do exist .
Many times however , they are very hard to calculate .
Therefore , very often , approximations are used .
There are two kinds of such approximations , Monte-Carlo algorithms and Las-Vegas algorithms .
Graphs are normally represented by two different sets , typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph .
The set E is a binary set , whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices .
If any two nodes have an edge between them , then the graph is called the complete graph .
I would move forth to define a Path , a Walk , A weighted graph , a directional graph .
Then make a comment about how all trees are just subsets of graphs .
It could also be proven that all connected graphs may be represented as a Tree .
There is more to graph theory than explained here .
A goatee is a beard formed by a tuft of hair under the chin , resembling that of a billy goat .
Herm is the smallest of the Channel Islands that is open to the public .
Herm is only 1 Â 1\/2 miles long .
Cars are banned from the small island just like its Channel Island neighbor , Sark .
Unlike Sark , bicycles are banned too .
The sandy white beaches make Herm a walker 's paradise .
History is the study of past events .
People know what happened in the past by looking at things from the past , including records -LRB- like books , newspapers and letters -RRB- and artifacts -LRB- like pottery , tools , and human or animal remains -RRB- .
Libraries , archives and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history .
A person who studies history is called a historian .
A person who studies pre-history and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist .
A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist .
The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography .
People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past .
This is called oral history .
When people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old , some historians recorded everything that they said , so that history would not be lost .
In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often .
Some groups of people never met each other .
Medieval Europe , Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were `` barbarian '' .
Current events , modern economic history , modern social history and modern intellectual history take very different views of the way history has affected the way that we think today .
Health is `` a state of complete physical , mental , and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity '' , according to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- .
Physical is about the body .
Mental is about how people think and feel .
Social talks about how people live with other people .
It is about family , work , school , and friends .
Some people also include spiritual health , which talks about the spirit or soul .
It concerns religious parts of people but not only that : the spiritual aspect of a person can be understood as that which desires peace , hope , security and connectedness to the universe .
Physical fitness refers to good body health , and is the result of regular exercise , proper diet and nutrition , and proper rest for physical recovery .
A good way of knowing if a group of people is healthy is their weight , which generally increases with better nutrition .
Mental health refers to a person 's emotional and psychological well-being .
`` A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional -LRB- feeling -RRB- abilities , function in society , and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life . ''
One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions .
Feeling capable and efficient ; being able to handle normal levels of stress , have good friends and family , and lead an independent life ; and being able to `` bounce back , '' or recover from hardships , are all signs of mental health .
Public Health refers to trying to stop a disease that is unhealthy to the community , and does not help in long life or promote your health .
This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society , public and private clubs , communities and individuals .
It is about the health of many people , or everybody , rather than one person .
Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through surveillance of cases .
To prevent being sick , it is good to do healthy behaviors such as hand washing , vaccination programs and using condoms .
When infectious diseases break out , washing hands may be especially important .
Harbour means to shelter or keep safe .
A harbor -LRB- or harbor -RRB- is a place where ships may shelter .
A port is also a harbor , but is usually bigger .
The port will often contain a water space with wave breakers around the edge , a number of quays or piers where the ships may be moored or tied up and a transport system for taking goods inland .
Often railway and road transport will be used .
Other ways that goods can be moved are pipeline transport and by using smaller ships on rivers .
During the D-Day operations of 1944 , two artifical harbors -LRB- named mulberry -RRB- were built just off the beaches where the invasion was going to happen .
Hawaii is a U.S. state of the United States .
It is the last state which joined the United States .
Hawaii became a state on August 21 , 1959 .
It is the only state made only of islands .
Hawaii is also the name of the largest island .
The capital and largest city of Hawaii is Honolulu on the island named Oahu .
Hawaii is known as the `` Aloha State '' .
Aloha is a Hawaiian word that has many meanings like welcome , hello and goodbye .
Aloha also means love and care .
The different meanings are brought together in the term `` Aloha Spirit '' to describe the friendly people of Hawaii .
The state flower is the yellow hibiscus -LRB- Hibiscus brackenridgei or ma ` o hau hele -RRB- .
The state bird is the Hawaiian goose -LRB- nene -RRB- .
The state fish is the reef triggerfish , also called the humu humu nuku nuku apua ` a .
The state tree is the candlenut , also called kukui .
The state song is Hawaii Ponoi .
The state motto is Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono .
In English it says , The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness .
The first people of Hawaii were Polynesians .
They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD .
Captain James Cook is given credit for discovering the islands for the Europeans in 1778 .
Others may have been there before him .
Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth Earl of Sandwich , John Montague .
Kamehameha I was the first king of Hawaii .
He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795 .
In 1893 , American soldiers stopped Queen Liliuokalani from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws .
She was the last monarch of Hawaii .
She also wrote the original words of the song called Aloha Oe .
The American business people made Hawaii into a republic for a short time .
The new leader , Sanford Dole was called the President of Hawaii .
In 1898 , the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a territory .
In 1959 , Hawaii became the fiftieth American state .
Hawaii is an archipelago ; a long chain of islands .
There are eight main islands and many small islands and atolls .
They are the tops of underwater volcanos .
The main islands are Niihau , Kauai , Oahu , Molokai , Lanai , Kahoolawe , Maui and Hawaii .
The biggest industry of Hawaii is tourism .
Almost 7 million people visited in 2000 .
Important exports are sugar , pineapple , macadamia nuts , and coffee .
Popular tourist sites include Waikiki Beach , Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , Polynesian Cultural Center , and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor .
The Island of Hawai ` i is the largest of the U.S. Hawaiian Islands , and the southern .
The island is built from seven separate shield volcanoes that erupted more or less one at a time , one partly covering the other .
The later volcanoes mostly buried two of the earlier ones .
These are -LRB- from oldest to youngest -RRB- : Kohala -LRB- extinct -RRB- , Ninole -LRB- extinct , mostly buried -RRB- , Mauna Kea -LRB- extinct or dormant ? -RRB-
, Hualalai -LRB- dormant -RRB- , Mauna Loa -LRB- active -RRB- , Kulani -LRB- extinct , mostly buried -RRB- , and Kilauea -LRB- very active -RRB- .
The largest city on the island is Hilo .
Hilo is filled with historic buildings , interesting shops , parks and has a constant stream of performances , festivals and events .
It is on the rainy east side of the island .
The city of Kailua-Kona is on the dry west side of Hawaii , and is popular with tourists .
Called locally the `` Big Island , '' its area is 4,038 sq . miles -LRB- 10 458 square kilometers -RRB- .
The widest part of the island is 93 miles -LRB- 150 km -RRB- across .
The Big Island makes up more than half -LRB- ~ 62 % -RRB- of the total land area of the State of Hawaii and is governed under the County of Hawaii .
Healing is a process that happens in the body .
Through healing , cells are able to repair damaged tissue .
Most healing processes combine both ways of healing .
The history of Australia begins with Aboriginal Australians who arrived here 60,000 years ago .
The British came to Sydney in 1788 and started prison colonies .
Later those colonies became self governing democracies .
After a vote , the colonies joined to become one nation called the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 .
People have lived in Australia for about 40,000-60 ,000 years .
The first people who arrived in what is now Australia are called the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders .
We think the Aborigines came by boat from the islands of what is now Indonesia .
They lived in all parts of Australia .
Their lives were simple , they had very few needs .
They lived by hunting , fishing and gathering food .
They lived in bands , and they spoke many different languages .
Aborigines invented tools like the boomerang and spear , but did not farm .
Tradition was very important in their lives .
Their religion is called the Dreamtime , which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits .
Aboriginal art started at least 30,000 years ago and there are lots of Dreamtime stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia .
Aboriginal music has songs about the Dreamtime , sometimes with special instruments like the didgeridoo .
In 1606 , the first European , Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon -LRB- 1571 â `` 1638 -RRB- , visited the west coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland .
A Spanish explorer , Luis Vaez de Torres sailed through the water between Australia and Papua New Guinea later that year .
Other Europeans then began to map or visit the north and west coast - which they called New Holland .
This was dry and apparently uninhabitable land , and they found no economic reasons to stay .
In 1642 , Abel Tasman , working for the Dutch East India Company reached Tasmania .
In 1688 , William Dampier became the first Englishman to reach Australia .
But in 1770 a British sailor , Captain James Cook , found the fertile east coast of Australia .
He called it New South Wales , and claimed it for Britain .
This was unjust because he saw the campfires and tents of unknown people .
The British decided to use the land visited by Captain Cook as a prison colony .
Britain needed a place to send its convicts -LRB- people who had been sent to jail for theft and other crimes -RRB- because its gaols were full and it had just lost its American colonies in the American War of Independence .
In 1788 the British First Fleet of 11 ships , carrying about 1500 people arrived at Sydney .
Arthur Phillip led them as the first Governor of New South Wales .
About 160 000 convicts were brought to Australia from 1788 until 1868 .
Free immigrants began arriving in the 1790s .
For the first few years they did not have much food , and life was very hard .
But soon they began to farm , and more people came .
Sydney grew , and new towns were started .
Wool brought good money .
By 1822 , many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited Sydney for additional economic resources .
Soon people from Sydney found other parts of Australia .
George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed south to Tasmania and a colony was started at Hobart in 1803 .
Hamilton Hume and William Hovell went south from Sydney by land .
They found the Murray River , and good land in Victoria .
Thomas Mitchell went inland , and found more rivers .
In 1826 , the first British military outpost was set up at King George Sound in Western Australia .
The Swan River Colony was started in 1829 , with townsites at Fremantle and Perth .
In 1836 , a free-settler colony was started in South Australia , where no convicts were ever sent .
Queensland became a separate colony in 1859 .
As the towns and farms spread across Australia , the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land .
Some were killed , and many died from illness and hunger .
Soon , Australia 's Aborigines were outnumbered by Europeans , and many were made to live on reserves .
The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold .
The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry .
By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people , very rich .
Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came .
The people in Australia wanted to run their own country , and not be told what to do from London .
The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London .
Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy .
The New South Wales Legislative Council , was created in 1825 to advise the Governor of New South Wales , but it was not chosen by voters .
William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association -LRB- Australia 's first political party -RRB- in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales .
In 1840 , the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were started and some people could vote for them -LRB- but only men with a certain amount of money -RRB- .
Then , Australia 's first parliamentary elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843 , again with some limits on who could vote .
The Australian Colonies Government Act -LRB- 1850 -RRB- allowed constitutions for New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania .
In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania .
In 1855 , limited self government was granted by London to New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania .
An new secret ballot was introduced in Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia in 1856 , allowing people to vote in private .
This system was copied around the world .
In 1855 , the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia .
The other colonies soon followed .
Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections .
In 1897 , Catherine Helen Spence became the first female political candidate .
Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent .
But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament .
Until 1901 , Australia was not a nation , it was six separate colonies governed by Britain .
This worked well when everybody was British and there were only a few people .
But now there were thousands of people and many of them had never been to Britain , an eight month journey away by sea .
If people in one colony wanted to buy or sell things to people in another colony , they had to ask permission .
They decided to join together to form one new country , the Commonwealth of Australia .
This was called Federation , and happened in 1901 .
But Australia was still part of the British Empire , and still felt very close to Britain and the British Kings and Queens .
Australia soon had its own money , and its own Army and Navy .
Because Australia was a very big country , and was so close to Asia , the Australians feared that people from Asia might take the country over .
So they passed a law that only people from Britain or other European countries could come to Australia .
This was called the White Australia policy .
It lasted for more than 60 years .
In Australia at this time , the trade unions were very strong , and they started a political party , the Australian Labor Party .
Australia passed many laws to help the workers , but they only wanted British workers in Australia .
Australia was also one of the first places in the world where women could vote .
In 1914 , the First World War started in Europe .
Australia joined in on the side of Britain , France and Russia , against Germany , Austria-Hungary and Turkey .
Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli , in Turkey .
They fought bravely , but were beaten by the Turks .
Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day .
They also fought on the Western Front in France and Belgium .
Australia and its Allies won the war but more than 60,000 Australians were killed .
Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s then got worried about the coming Second World War .
In 1939 the war started when Nazi Germany invaded Poland .
Again Australia joined in to help Britain .
But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore when Japan attacked .
Then Japan started attacking Australia , and Australians had to fight close to home for the first time .
Many people feared that Japan would invade Australia .
But with help from the United States , the Japanese were stopped .
After the war , Australia became a close friend of the United States .
When the war ended , Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work .
So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war .
It did things like build the Snowy Mountains Scheme .
Over the next 25 years , millions of people came to Australia .
They came from Italy , Greece , Yugoslavia , Poland and other countries in Europe .
Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon .
An important new party , the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972 , then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party .
Whitlam made changes , but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor General sacked him and forced an election in 1975 .
Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party .
In the 1960s the White Australia Policy was ended .
Many people came to Australia from China , Vietnam , Malaysia and other countries in Asia .
Some Australians began to think of their country as being a part of Asia for the first time .
But other Australians did not like this and said that Australia should keep its European character .
Others thought Australian could be multicultural and accept all cultures .
In the 1960s and 1970s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world , because it could mine a lot of iron and other things from the ground and products like wool that other countries wanted to buy .
Australian traded with Britain then more and more with the United States and Japan .
Australia also supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq .
Some Australians protested against these wars .
Australia 's democracy meant that both sides could say what they thought and did not have to fight if they did not want to .
Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like Cambodia , Rwanda and East Timor .
In 1973 , the famous Sydney Opera House opened .
In the 1970s , 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies , actors and singers became really famous around the world .
In the year 2000 , Sydney had the Summer Olympics .
Australians like sports and have won lots of world cups in things like rugby union , rugby league , netball and cricket .
In the 1980s and 90s , the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating , then the Liberal Party under John Howard made lots of changes to the economy .
Australia had a bad recession in 1991 , but but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008 , Australia stayed pretty strong .
Today Australia is a rich , peaceful and democratic country .
But it still has problems .
Some people are still poor , mainly those who do not have jobs -LRB- around 4-5 % of Australians could not get a job in 2010 -RRB- , or whose farms do not make enough money -LRB- but not many Australians work on farms -RRB- .
A lot of land in Australia -LRB- like Uluru -RRB- has been returned to Aboriginal people , but in some places Aboriginal people want to get back control of land where other Australians are living , which is hard to deal with .
Australians do not always agree about what to do about this .
But most Australian live in cities where this is not a problem .
Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia .
These people may come because they want to do business , or to live in a democracy , to join their family , or because they are refugees -LRB- people trying to get away from war and bad governments around the world -RRB- .
All the main leaders think this is a good idea and so Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two , including around 660,000 refugees .
But - some people who say they are refugees want to come to Australia by boat without asking the government first .
They travel in very dangerous boats organised by people smugglers and lots of people have drowned on the way .
Many Australians disagree on what to do with these types of immigrants - some want to let them stay and live in Australia , others do not want to let them in and others are worried that more people will drown if the government just lets smugglers organise things .
Spain is a country located in Europe .
People have lived on the Iberian Peninsula for about 500,000 years .
Neanderthal man came about 200,000 years ago .
Modern humans first came about 40,000 years .
The Roman Empire controlled Spain for three hundred years ; then people from Northern Europe called the Visigoths fought for Spain and won it from the Romans .
They were Christians , and they controlled Spain for two hundred years .
A lot of people took over Spain from the 13th century but by the end of the 19th Century Spain was fairly poor , and was ruled by French people .
Britain sent its own troops to defend Spain since it was so weak .
This put first France , then Britain , in control of Spain for the rest of that century .
Today Britain has strong ties to Spain from this time .
9th century Roman Catholics from Europe eventually decided to fight to take Spain from the Muslims .
They fought wars for many hundreds of years , some of which were Crusades against other Christians like the Cathars .
These were very cruel wars .
In the year 1492 , they took the last part of Spain that had belonged to the Moors .
Internal feuds , corruption , and divisions had caused Baghdad to fall to the Mongols in 1258 .
Spain went similarly .
Boabdil , the last Moorish Prince of Granada , gave the keys to King Ferdinand of Aragon on 2 January 1492 .
It was he who now ruled all of Spain :
Before this , several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called Spain .
Two of these countries , Castile and Aragon , came together when the king of Aragon , Ferdinand II , married the queen of Castile , Isabella .
In the same year , 1492 , they decided to send Christopher Columbus to explore the Atlantic Ocean .
Columbus found a land there that the people of Europe did not yet know .
These were the islands of the Caribbean Sea .
Columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two continents there - North America and South America .
Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America , and they took over very large parts of those two continents .
Owning this empire made Spain very rich .
But when they conquered that empire , they killed millions of the Native Americans who had lived there before .
Spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years .
Meanwhile , at home , the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries .
Jews had been expelled from Spain .
The multicultural society was destroyed , and so was the learning .
Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in music : harmony and stringed instruments , and of course the buildings , many of which became churches , by adding crosses .
The Spanish Empire was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries , thanks to gold from the Americas .
This new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich .
Meanwhile others ' savings became worth less due to inflation .
Spain became a society of very rich and very poor .
Some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the Caribbean , Central America and South America , mostly to find gold .
Native American peoples were killed by diseases brought by the Spaniards , but most Spaniards did not know this .
They found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers .
The Spaniards thought this meant they were inferior , and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives .
Millions of natives died mining gold for the Spanish .
The Spanish Empire also at this time funded the Spanish Inquisition which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church .
The Reformation which created Protestant sects in Europe was not allowed into Spain , it was kept out and , as with Jews or Muslims , its believers were killed .
The nobles of Spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over .
No one could challenge their power .
In many ways it was held together as a reign of terror .
People who challenged them were often called heretics , so that the Inquisition could torture them , and then nobles take the property .
For ordinary people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean , life got worse .
A few rulers got rich .
Today we would say that these people were guilty of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
Many Church people who had the power to speak out at that time , did so , and they said many of the same things as we would say today .
But none of this mattered much to the rulers .
The great satire Don Quixote was written about this time .
In the 18th century , there was doubt over who should become king of Spain ; this doubt led many of the kings of Europe to fight to become king of Spain .
This was called the War of the Spanish Succession .
France occupied Spain for a long time .
This made Spain very weak .
It also made Spain lose its empire in North and South America ; all of the parts of that empire became their own countries , or were taken over by other countries such as the United States of America .
There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the 20th century .
Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people -LRB- a democracy -RRB- , and they made the King of Spain leave the country .
However , in 1936 , two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy , or take orders from one person .
In 1939 , those who wanted democracy were defeated , and a dictator named Francisco Franco took over the government .
Franco died in 1975 .
He had decided that Spain should have a king again , and he chose Juan Carlos , the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country , to be king .
But the king did not rule as a dictator ; instead , he chose to set up a democracy .
Now Spain is a modern democratic country , and does business with many countries around the world .
It is a part of the European Union .
Height is the distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object .
For example , people consider the bottom of the foot a person 's lowest end , and the top of the head a person 's highest end .
The distance between my lowest end -- the bottom of my foot -- and my highest end -- the top of my head -- measures out to 64 inches , so my height measures out to 64 inches too .
My height is 64 inches .
A historian is someone who studies history .
Historians study the passage of time and the events that happen within that passage .
The human body is the body of a person .
It is the physical structure of a person .
The body is a thing that can be hurt or killed .
Its functions are stopped by death .
Some people study the human body .
They look at where it is different from or the same as other animals ' bodies .
These animals can be alive today .
Or they can be extinct animals like other hominids .
-LRB- Hominids are primates that are close to humans .
Neanderthals and Homo erectus were hominids . -RRB-
Some people study how the human body works and lives in its environment .
Some people study what people think about their body .
Artists study how to draw or paint the human body .
it has many senses which can let him feel pain or other things
Scientists think that the human body is very much like other animals .
They see that some human behaviors are like animal behaviors .
-LRB- Behaviors are the way an organism acts . -RRB-
They know that 98 % of the DNA in humans is the same as other primates .
The animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the chimpanzee .
98.4 % of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees .
Hydrogen is a chemical element .
Its atomic number is 1 , which makes it the simplest element in the entire universe .
In its pure form , hydrogen is most commonly found on Earth as a gas .
Hydrogen is also a part of water .
However , a water molecule is actually made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom , connected together .
Hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that powers the Sun and other stars .
Hydrogen takes up about 75 % of the entire Universe .
Hydrogen 's symbol on the Periodic Table of Elements is H.
Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen atoms connected together .
Scientists call these diatomic molecules .
Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements .
It has no color or smell .
Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the Earth 's atmosphere .
In nature , it is mostly found as a part of water .
Hydrogen is also found in all living things , as a part of the organic compounds that living things are made of -RRB- .
In addition , hydrogen atoms can combine with carbon atoms to form hydrocarbons .
Petroleum and other fossil fuels are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to create energy for human use .
Hydrogen has two different isotopes which are heavier types of the Hydrogen atom , they are called : deuterium and tritium .
These other types of Hydrogen are important in nuclear energy .
The name `` hydrogen '' comes from the Greek word for water , ' Ï
Î Î Ï -LRB- pronounced \/ HEEW-dor \/ -RRB- .
Scientists believe atoms are made of protons , neutrons and electrons .
From a physics point of view , hydrogen has one proton , and its variants -LRB- atoms that are very like hydrogen -RRB- , deuterium and tritium , also have neutrons .
Nuclear fusion is a very powerful source of energy .
It relies on forcing atoms together to make helium and energy , exactly as happens in a star like the Sun , or in a hydrogen bomb .
This needs a large amount of energy to get started , and is not easy to do yet .
A big advantage over nuclear fission , which is used in nuclear power stations , is that no waste is produced , and no toxic fuel like uranium is needed .
There is a lot of deuterium in seawater .
There is more than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergoing fusion every second on the sun .
1 .
Water can be easily broken down into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity , but it takes a lot of electricity to get a usable amount of hydrogen .
2 .
Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make steam -LRB- pure water -RRB- .
3 .
A fuel cell combines hydrogen with an oxygen molecule releasing an electron as electricity .
For these reasons , many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace technologies such as diesel-electric engines and biodiesel fuel .
But it is not correct to see hydrogen as a fuel if it is used in a fuel cell .
It is more of a replacement for the power grid .
Such a grid and infrastructure with new vehicles might be first made in Iceland , a country that has much free geothermal energy and is quite small .
Because it imports all fossil fuel , it would help Iceland to completely stop using it .
The huge advantage of hydrogen is that when burnt in an engine or in a fuel cell , there is no pollution - just a small amount of water .
If we did move to a hydrogen economy where could the hydrogen come from ?
Well , there are many places - it can be extracted from water -LRB- but this of course will use more energy than you would get back by using it in a fuel cell or an engine -RRB- .
It can be extracted from various types of plant material - corn is possible , though pretty inefficient .
Generally it is probably better to refine such material into a more conventional fuel like ethanol .
Helium is a chemical element .
It has the chemical symbol He and atomic number 2 .
Helium is called a noble gas , because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new compounds .
It has the lowest boiling point of all the elements .
It is the second most common element in the universe , after hydrogen , and has no color or smell .
However , Helium has a blue-ish , neon color when being burnt with fire .
Helium does not usually react with anything else .
However , it can react with tungsten , iodine , fluorine , sulfur and phosphorus under very special conditions .
Astronomers found helium in 1868 .
They found that it was in the Sun before it was found on Earth .
Because of where it was found , its name comes from the Greek word for Sun , helios .
It is used to fill balloons and airships because it is lighter than air , and does not burn or react , meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way .
It is also used in some kinds of light bulbs .
People also breathe it in to make their voices sound higher than they normally do as a joke , but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much , since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air .
Breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to vocal cords .
It can be created through the process of nuclear fusion in the sun .
During this process , four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one Helium atom .
Hair is something that grows from the skin of mammals .
The hair of non-human animals is usually called fur .
Sheep and goats have curly hair , which is usually called wool .
Hair is made of keratin .
Keratins are proteins , long chains of amino acids .
Humans and some other animals have lost much of their hair through evolution , and some other mammals , such as the elephant and the whale , have almost none at all .
Other animals , for example certain insects and spiders also have hairs ; these are however not true hair in the biological sense , but rather bristles .
The hairs found on certain plants are also not true hair , but Trichomes .
In humans , hair grows mostly on the head , and the amount of body hair is different from race to race .
Asians and native North Americans have the least amount of body hair , while Caucasians tend to have the most .
Hair color is passed down by parents only .
Natural hair color can be given only by genes .
It is impossible to have a hair color that is not passed down genetically by both mother and father .
This relies on dominant and recessive genes carried by a parent .
These genes may not be the color of their hair , however , many people carry genes that are recessive and do not show in their traits or features .
Dyeing hair is to change the color of hair .
It consists of a chemical mixture which can change the color of hair by a chemical reaction .
Many people dye their hair to hide gray or white hairs .
This is because most people gain white or gray hairs as they grow older .
Two types of melanin pigment give hair its color : eumelanin and pheomelanin .
Pheomelanin colors hair red .
Eumelanin determines the darkness of the hair color .
A low concentration of brown eumelanin results in blond hair , whereas a higher concentration of brown eumelanin will color the hair brown .
High amounts of black eumelanin result in black hair , while low concentrations give gray hair .
All humans have some pheomelanin in their hair .
The genetics of hair colors are not yet firmly established .
According to one theory , at least two gene pairs control human hair color .
One phenotype -LRB- brown\/blond -RRB- has a dominant brown allele and a recessive blond allele .
A person with a brown allele will have brown hair ; a person with no brown alleles will be blond .
This explains why two brown-haired parents can produce a blond-haired child .
The other gene pair is a non-red\/red pair , where the not-red allele is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive .
A person with two copies of the red-haired allele will have red hair , but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair , respectively .
The two-gene model does not account for all possible shades of brown , blond , or red -LRB- for example , platinum blond versus dark blonde\/light brown -RRB- , nor does it explain why hair color sometimes darkens as a person ages .
Several other gene pairs control the light versus dark hair color in a cumulative effect -LRB- quantitative genetics -RRB- .
Hair texture is also inherited genetically .
The thickness of hair , its color and its tendency to curl are all inherited .
There are also genetic differences between men and women .
Almost all baldness is male , for example .
Body hair is limited in women , and thicker in men .
People have about 100,000 strands of hair on their head .
About 100 fall out each day , but they usually grow back .
Most men are bald but girls and woman are only bald if they loose their hair from a desise called Alipecia .
Men often lose some of their hair as they grow older .
This is known as baldness , and doctors call it `` male pattern baldness '' .
Its name comes from the fact that hair loss almost always follows the same pattern .
It begins by hair falling out first from the front and sides of the head , and thinning from the top of the head , usually until it is all gone .
After a while , all that may be left is a fringe of hair running above the ears and around the lower back of the head .
Even though it is unusual for women to go bald , many women suffer from thinning hair over the top of their head as they grow old .
People have tried to find cures for hair loss for thousands of years .
In an effort to get their hair back , men have tried `` cures '' like applying strange lotions or even having their heads packed in chicken manure .
Many unproven `` cures '' are still marketed today .
It is only in the last decade or so that treatments have been developed which do sometimes work .
Some doctors do hair transplants , where they take tiny plugs of hair from areas like the back of the neck and plant them in the bald spots on the head .
Some drugs have been tested and approved for sale as hair loss treatments .
They encourage hair regrowth and thickening , but work better if applied before hair loss turns to baldness .
People have been interested in head hair for hundreds of thousands of years .
For both men and women , styling and coloring of hair have been a way to look good , and get prestige .
Sometimes society makes rules about hair , for example by not allowing people to cut their hair or beards .
This article is about the island of Ireland .
For the country of Ireland that is located on the island , see Republic of Ireland .
Ireland is an island in Europe .
To the west of Ireland is the Atlantic Ocean ; to the east of Ireland , across the Irish Sea , is the island of Great Britain .
The island of Ireland , also called Ã ire when speaking in the Irish language , is about 302 m long and about 179 m wide .
Six million people live in Ireland .
Around four and a half million in the Republic and the remaining two million in the North .
The River Shannon , which runs from north to south , is the longest river on the island .
Ireland has many lakes -LRB- or Loughs -RRB- .
Lough Neagh , in Northern Ireland , is the largest lake in Ireland .
Ireland is known for its beautiful landscapes , music , history , and mythology .
There are 32 counties in Ireland .
The island of Ireland is split into two main parts :
More than one million people live in Dublin .
1\/6 of Ireland 's population lives there .
Many people live in the eastern coast of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland as well , because that side is closest to Europe and was settled first by the ancient peoples of Ireland .
Ireland was ruled by Britain since the 1600 's .
Hundreds of years of British rule spread the English language through the island .
The Irish were mostly Catholic and the British were Protestant , so the Irish did not like British rule and often rebelled against it .
In the 1900 's the Republic Ireland became independent of the United Kingdom , but Northern Ireland chose to remain part of Britain .
The north was converted to Protestantism by the British , but the rest of Ireland did not convert , which is the main reason for the division today .
A lot of Irish people also left Ireland and immigrated to the United States , Canada , Australia , and South America while the island was ruled by Britain .
This was largely because Ireland was poor under British rule and the Irish had to go to other countries for opportunities .
Another major reason to leave was the potato famine in the 1860 's .
The farmers in Ireland who grew potatoes were n't able to grow enough food because a disease killed most of the potato crop .
It is estimated almost a million people died of starvation .
Today 6 million people live in Ireland and almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants .
The Internet is a large group of computers that are connected to each other .
The Internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world .
It has millions of smaller domestic , academic , business , and government networks , which together carry lots of different information and services .
The Internet was created in the United States by the `` United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency '' -LRB- known as DARPA -RRB- .
It was first connected in October , 1969 .
The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1989 by a British -LRB- UK -RRB- man named Tim Berners-Lee .
Today , people can pay a fee to access the Internet from Internet Service Providers .
Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use .
Sometimes the people who offer these free services use advertising to make money from them .
The alternative -LRB- other -RRB- name , `` Net '' came from `` Inter -LRB- net -RRB- '' .
The Internet is used for many things , such as electronic mail , online chat , file transfer , and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web .
The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web -LRB- which is also called the `` Web '' -RRB- .
The Web contains websites , blogs , and also wikis -- including Wikipedia .
Webpages on the Web can be seen and read by anyone -LRB- unless the page needs a password , or it is blocked -RRB- .
The second major use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail .
E-mail is private and goes from one user to another .
Instant messaging -LRB- such as AIM or ICQ -RRB- is similar to email , but allows two or more people to chat to each other much faster .
Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing , and block all or part of it .
For example , the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad .
Many times no one in China can read it or add to it .
Some parents block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see .
Well-known examples of the whole Internet being blocked are in North Korea and Myanmar .
The Internet can also be a dangerous place .
Information people put on the Internet is not always checked , and some may be not true .
Some may even be harmful .
Also , if you send information through the internet , sometimes other people can read it even when they are not supposed to .
For example , Facebook has had some problems with privacy settings .
Posting any information about yourself on a website is often a bad idea unless you are very sure what you are doing .
A good way to check for a secure website is to make sure the url starts with https : \/ \/ instead of http : \/ \/ , this means it is a secure site .
-LRB- This only stops other people from reading what you type .
It does not mean the website is safe -RRB-

An `` idiom '' is a word or phrase which means something different from what it says - it is usually a metaphor .
Idioms are common phrases or terms whose meanings are not literal , but are figurative and only known through their common uses .
Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly .
Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times .
The idiom shape up or ship out , which is like saying improve your behavior or leave if you do n't , might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee , but not to other people .
Idioms are not the same thing as slang .
Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known by almost everyone .
Slang is usually special words that are known only by a particular group .
To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language , and how and when to use them .
But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings .
In order to understand an idiom , one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from .
To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting , but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly .
For example most native British English speakers know that `` No room to swing a cat '' means `` there was not a lot of space '' and can use the idiom properly , but few know it is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a whip called a `` cat o ` nine tails '' .
A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had a lot of room to swing the cat .
A better understanding of an idiom is that it is a phrase whose meaning can not be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately .
In this case , a metaphor is not an idiom .
The meaning of the saying `` run like the wind '' can be understood by looking the words up in a dictionary and using some common sense and imagination and the context of the phrase .
A way to wish someone good luck .
To enjoy life , to live wildly .
To die .
To cry about something but without actually caring .

It 's raining hard .
To get into trouble .
To be scared .
Leader .
To think that something is wrong .
Not doing an activity because of fear .
To quit .

There are two broad , artificial subdivisions of mammalian immune systems : the innate -LRB- or natural -RRB- and the acquired -LRB- or adaptive -RRB- .
The innate immune system is usually meant to encompass cells and systems in the mammalian immune system that does not require previous exposure to a particular pathogen for function .
Innate immunity starts with the skin , which is an excellent barrier to infection .
The adaptive immune system includes cells and systems that require previous exposure .
It explains the unique ability of the mammalian immune system to ` remember ' previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections .
This immunological memory is due to the biology of T-cells and B-cells .
Herd immunity for instance is acquired by organisms living close together sharing minor infections all the time .
Vaccines boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off and remember how to do so - when a stronger infection arises the body thus fights it off readily .
The distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting cures can be considered another level of acquired immune system , one governed by access to vaccination and medicine in general .
The intersection of this with the spread of disease -LRB- as studied in epidemiology -RRB- is part of the field of public health .
Errors of the immune system often cause more damage than what they are detecting and reacting to .
In autoimmune diseases , the body attacks parts of itself because the system mistakes some parts of the body as ` foreign ' .
Some kinds of arthritis are cause this way .
Alternatively , some serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept .
That is how viruses work , and once inside their genetic material takes over the host cells .
Infections like HIV get in this way , and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system .
Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV-challenged body , and prevent the onset of AIDS .
This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves literally every level of that system .
This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the human body .
The natural or innate immune system of the human body is linked very deeply and directly to the nervous system and sensory system , a link first explored by studies on epilepsy .
An epileptic attack is actually an immune system reaction triggered by a purely sensory or nervous input , like a strobe light .
There are also studies of long term HIV survivors which suggest very strongly that psychology is a key healing factor and that it is quite possible to survive long term with very low immune system function if one avoids major psychological stress and stays quite calm and optimistic regardless of news .
This might be because of the immune system 's tendency to panic under conditions of high stress , to the detriment of the organism , sometimes attacking it from the inside .
Because of these issues , a view is evolving of a single system that responds cognitively to perception , physiologically with pain via nerves , and immunologically with the cells and chemical elements of the immune system that float in the blood , lymphatic system and tissues .
The study of this system is psychoneuroimmunology .
The immune system protects the body .
Infinity , also written , is the name for a group of ideas about things which never end .
The term is from a Latin word meaning `` without end '' .
Infinity goes on forever , so sometimes space , numbers , and other things are said to be ` infinite ' , because they never come to a stop .
Infinity is really not an ordinary number , but it is sometimes used as one .
Infinity can be broken up in two different kinds ; potential and actual infinity .
Potential infinity is a process that never stops .
For example , adding 10 to a number .
No matter how many times 10 is added , 10 more can still be added .
Actual infinity is a more abstract idea .
For example , there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down .
January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars .
It has 31 days .
January is named for Janus , the Roman god of doors and gateways .
January and February were put on the calendar after all the other months .
This is because in the original Roman calendar , winter did not have months .
Although March was originally the first month , January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls -LRB- Roman leaders -RRB- .
January 's flower is the carnation with its birthstone being the garnet .
The meaning of the garnet is constancy .
The first day of January is called New Year 's Day .
In some countries it has the name of Saint Sylvester .
June is the sixth month of the year .
It has 30 days .
June is named for the Roman goddess Juno , the wife of Jupiter .
She is goddess of marriage .
Because of this , getting married in June was thought to be lucky .
June begins on a different day of the week each year .
June 's flower is the Rose .
Its birthstone is the pearl .
The meaning for the birthstone pearl is health .
July is the seventh month of the year .
It has 31 days .
July was named after Julius Caesar .
The month begins on the same day of the week as April every year and also January in leap years .
July 's flower is the water lily .
Its birthstone is the ruby .
The meaning for the birthstone ruby is contented mind .
Independence Day in the United States or Fourth of July is on July 4 .
Japan -LRB- æ -- æ , Nippon -RRB- is a country in Asia .
It has many islands .
Four of them are big , and the biggest is one of the largest islands in the world .
This island is called Honshu .
The islands are on the east Asian coast in the western part of the Pacific Ocean .
Japanese people call their country `` Nihon '' or `` Nippon '' , which in Japanese means `` the origin of the sun '' .
The earliest records on Japan are from Chinese documents .
One of those records said there were many small countries -LRB- in Japan -RRB- which had wars between them and later a country , ruled by a queen , became the strongest and peace came .
Japan began to write its own history after the 5th and 6th centuries , when people from Korea and China taught Japan about the Chinese writing system .
Japan 's neighbors also showed them the ways of Buddhism .
The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways , for example , by building strongly on ideas such as Zen , which came from mainland Asia .
In the ancient and the Middle Ages , China gave Japan lots of new cultural ideas , but their friendship became weaker later .
In the late 13th century , Mongolians from China tried to invade Japan twice , but they could not .
The samurai and shogun of Medieval Japan are similar to knights and lords in Medieval Europe .
Japan had contact with the Europeans for a little while in the 16th century .
The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Japan .
Later , the Spanish , English and Dutch came to Japan to trade .
Also , they brought Christianity .
Japan 's leaders welcomed them originally , but the Europeans conquered many places in the world , and the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too .
So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore , except in a small area in Nagasaki city .
Only Chinese , Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan , in the end , and they were under careful control of the Japanese government .
Japan was opened again in 1854 by Matthew Perry , when the Americans wanted to use Japanese ports for American whale boats .
This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture .
The Meiji Restoration of 1868 stopped some old ways and added many new ones .
The Empire of Japan was created , and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it .
It invaded and annexed Ryukyu Kingdom , Taiwan , and Korea .
It had wars with China and Russia : the First Sino-Japanese War , the Russo-Japanese War , and the Second Sino-Japanese War , which grew to become a part of World War 2 .
In 1941 , Japan hit Pearl Harbor in Hawaii , a water base of the United States and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes .
This started the United States ' involvement in World War 2 .
American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific .
Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland America began to win , and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities .
America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat .
To make Japan surrender , the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , killing 150,000 Japanese citizens .
Soon after this the Soviet Union began to fight against Japan and the Japanese army in Manchuria lost .
Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries , accepting the Potsdam Proclamation .
The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new constitution , in which it promised to never go to war again .
Japan was hurt very much after the widespread bombing hits and the big bombs , but soon it grew strong again .
They did not try to make a strong army , but a lot of money .
Because of this , they became very wealthy .
The United States put their army bases in Japan , including Okinawa .
Although America helps protect Japan , some people living near the bases do not like the soldiers there because of serious problems the soldiers sometimes make .
Japan is a group of islands in the Western Pacific , off the coast of China .
The four biggest islands are Honshu , Hokkaido , Shikoku , and Kyushu , and there are about 6,000 smaller islands there .
Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the East Sea or the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea .
Honshu , which means ` Mainland ' in Japanese language , is the biggest island .
Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu .
Kyushu is the island west of Honshu .
Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu .
In the middle of Japan there are mountains .
Most of the mountains are volcanoes .
Japan has many earthquakes .
The recent big earthquake was in 1995 , near Kobe .
It killed many people .
90 % of the people living in Japan only live in 10 % of the land , near the coast .
The other 10 % of the people in Japan live away from the coast .
Over 10 cities have over a million people in them .
The biggest city in Japan is Tokyo , which is the capital .
Japan has 4 problems about territory .
There are several important international airports in Japan .
Narita is the major international airport in the Tokyo area .
Kansai International Airport serves as the main airport for Osaka , Kobe , and Kyoto .
ChÅ `` bu Centrair International Airport near Nagoya is the newest of the three .
Haneda Airport is close to central Tokyo and is the largest domestic airport in the country .
The Shinkansen is one of the fastest trains in the world and connects cities in Honshu and Kyushu .
Networks of public and private railways cover almost all of the country .
Travel between cities by bus is also popular .
Modern Japan is divided into 47 prefectures .
Before the Meiji period -LRB- 1868-1912 -RRB- , the nation was divided into provinces which were consolidated in the prefectural system .
In Japan , Sumo Wresling is an important traditional sport , and it is their national sport .
Other martial arts such as judo , karate , and kendo are also very popular , but baseball has the most fans in Japan .
Soccer , also called football is popular too .
It is popular to play and watch golf .
Jargon is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people .
They do not mean what the dictionary says they mean .
They have different meanings to the people using them than their everyday meaning .
For example , the ordinary words boot , net , and web also have special meanings for users of computers , the Internet , and the World Wide Web .
These , and to flame , to ping and many acronyms are part of net jargon .
An acronym means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used .
Often this is the first letter of each word .
Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand .
See list of slang words .
Usually , more jargon is created over time .
Jargon is also common in the military .
It includes phrases like SNAFU .
Jargon can be used by a clique to prevent others from joining or understanding , but it also is often just used because it is shorter .
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System .
It is the fifth planet from the Sun .
Jupiter is classed as a gas giant , because it is so large , and is made up mostly of gas .
The other gas giants are Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
Jupiter has a mass of 1.8986 Ã -- 1027 kg or about 317.83 Earths .
This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together .
Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye .
It was known to the ancient Romans , who named it after the Roman god Jupiter -LRB- Latin : Iuppiter -RRB- .
Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky .
Only the Earth 's moon and Venus are brighter .
Jupiter has at least 63 moons .
55 of these moons are very small and less than 5 km wide .
The four main moons are Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto .
These moons are the largest .
These four are called the Galilean moons , because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei .
Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System .
Jupiter is the biggest planet in the Solar System with a diameter of 142,984 km .
This is eleven times bigger than the diameter of Earth .
The atmosphere near the surface of Jupiter is made of about 88 to 92 % hydrogen , 8 to 12 % helium , and 1 % other gases .
Further into the planet it is so hot and the pressure so high that helium becomes a liquid and precipitates or rains further down into the planet .
Based on spectroscopy , Jupiter seems to be made of similar gases to Saturn .
It is not as similar to Neptune or Uranus .
These two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas .
The very high temperatures and pressures in Jupiter 's core mean scientists can not tell what materials would be there .
This can not be found out , because it is not possible to create the same amount of pressure on Earth .
Above the unknown inner core is an outer core .
The outer core of Jupiter is thick , liquid hydrogen .
The pressure is high enough to make the hydrogen solid , but then it melts because of the heat .
Jupiter is twice as massive as all the other planets in the Solar System put together .
Because of all the gas near the core , it gives off more heat than it gets from the sun .
Jupiter is 11 times the width of Earth and 318 times as massive .
The volume of Jupiter is 1,317 times the volume of Earth .
In other words , 1,317 Earth-sized objects could fit inside it .
Jupiter has many bands of clouds going horizontally across its surface .
The light parts are called zones and the darker are called belts .
The zones and belts often interact with each other .
This causes huge storms .
Wind speeds of 360 kilometres per hour -LRB- km\/h -RRB- are common on Jupiter .
To show the difference the strongest tropical storms on Earth are about 100 km\/h .
Most of the clouds on Jupiter are made of ammonia .
There may also be clouds of water vapor similar to clouds on Earth .
Spacecrafts such as Voyager 1 have seen lightning on the surface of the planet .
Scientists think it was water vapor because lightning needs water vapor .
These lightning bolts have been measured as up 1,000 times as powerful as those on Earth .
The brown and orange colors are caused when sunlight passes through or refracts with the many gases in the atmosphere .
One of the biggest features in Jupiter 's atmosphere is the Great Red Spot .
It is a huge storm which is bigger than the entire Earth .
It has been known about for just under 200 years and possibly even longer .
Storms can last for hours or as long as hundreds of years in the case of the Great Red Spot .
Jupiter has a magnetic field similar to Earth 's but 10 times stronger .
It is also has what is known as a magnetosphere .
The strength of the field is enough to be a serious danger to any spacecraft traveling past or to Jupiter .
The magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid metallic hydrogen in the core of Jupiter .
The four largest moons of Jupiter orbit or go around the planet within the magnetic field .
This protects them from the solar wind .
Jupiter 's magnetic field is so large , it reaches the orbit of Saturn 7.7 million miles away .
The Earth 's magnetosphere does not even cover its moon , less than a million miles away .
Jupiter also has a thin ring system .
The main and inner rings of Jupiter are made of small , dark particles .
The third ring , called the gossamer ring , is very transparent -LRB- see through -RRB- and it is made from microscopic debris .
The rings were discovered by NASA 's Voyager 1 probe in 1979 .
The orbit of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the Sun .
In the amount of time it takes for Jupiter to orbit the Sun one time , the Earth orbits the Sun 11.86 times .
One year on Jupiter is equal to 11.86 years on Earth .
The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million kilometres .
This is five times the distance between Earth and the Sun .
Jupiter is not tilted on its axis as much as the Earth or Mars .
This causes it to have no seasons , for example Summer or Winter .
Jupiter rotates , or spins around very quickly .
This causes the planet to bulge in the middle .
Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System .
It completes one rotation or spin in 10 hours .
Because of the bulge , the length of the equator of Jupiter is much longer than the length from pole to pole .
Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky , after the Moon and Venus .
Because of that , people have always been able to see it from Earth .
The first person known to really study the planet was Galileo Galilei in 1610 .
He was the first person to see Jupiter 's moons Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto .
This was because he used a telescope , unlike anyone before him .
No new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years .
In 1892 an astronomer called E.E Barnard found a new moon using his observatory in California .
He called the moon Amalthea .
It was the last of Jupiter 's 63 moons to be discovered by human observation through a telescope .
In 1994 , bits of the comet Shoemaker Levy-9 hit Jupiter .
It was the first time a collision or crash between two Solar System objects had been directly seen by people .
Eight spacecraft have either flown past or visited Jupiter since 1973 .
These were Pioneer 10 -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , Pioneer 11 -LRB- 1974 -RRB- , Voyagers 1 and 2 -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , Ulysses -LRB- 1992 and 2004 -RRB- , Cassini -LRB- 2000 -RRB- and New Horizons in 2007 .
The Pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of Jupiter and its moons .
Five years later , the two Voyager spacecraft discovered over 20 new moons .
They captured photo evidence of lightning on the night side of Jupiter .
The Ulysses probe was sent to study the Sun .
It only went to Jupiter after it had finished its main mission .
Ulysses had no cameras so it took no photographs .
In 2006 the Cassini spacecraft , on its way to Saturn , took some very good , very clear pictures of the planet .
Cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details .
The Galileo mission in 1995 was the only spacecraft to go into orbit around Jupiter .
It flew around the planet for seven years and studied all of the four biggest moons .
It launched a probe into the planet to get information about Jupiter 's atmosphere .
The probe traveled to a depth of about 150 km before it was crushed by the weight of all the gas above it .
This is called pressure .
The Galileo spacecraft was also crushed in 2003 when NASA steered the craft into the planet on purpose .
They did this so that the craft could not crash into Europa , a moon which scientists think might have life .
NASA is planning to send another spacecraft to Jupiter called Juno .
It will launch in August 2011 .
The craft will go into orbit around the planet in July 2016 .
Several missions have been planned to send spacecraft to Jupiter 's moons Europa and Callisto .
One called JIMO -LRB- Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter -RRB- was canceled in 2006 because it cost too much money .
Jupiter has 63 known moons .
Only 13 of these were first seen from Earth because the rest are too small .
The rest of the moons have since been seen by spacecraft .
The smallest moon -LRB- S\/2003 J 12 -RRB- is only 1 kilometre across .
The biggest , Ganymede , has a diameter of 5,262 kilometres .
It is bigger than the planet Mercury .
However , from Jupiter it looks only half as big as Io because it 's farther away .
Along with Io , Europa and Callisto , Ganymede is one of the Galilean moons , the four biggest moons of Jupiter .
Because of the way they orbit Jupiter , gravity affects three of these moons greatly .
The friction caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most volcanic object in the Solar System .
It has over 400 volcanoes , more than three times as many as Earth .
Jupiter 's large gravity has had a big effect on the Solar System .
Jupiter protects the inner planets from comets by pulling them towards itself .
Because of this Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System .
A group of asteroids called the Trojan asteroids follow Jupiter as it goes around the Sun .
It is the only planet that has a group of asteroids similar to this .
Knowledge means the things which are true , as opposed to opinion .
Information which is correct is knowledge .
Knowledge can always be supported by evidence .
That makes it justified ; it is not an opinion or a guess .
If someone understands an idea or is aware of something , then he or she has knowledge of it .
When it makes sense to someone , this knowledge becomes understanding .
A knowledgeable person is someone who knows a lot .
If someone has know-how it means that they can put knowledge to work in doing or building something .
Knowledge comes from being in an environment , having some experience there , and then sharing what was learned .
That way others may gain from what someone else knows .
When doing science , it may be necessary to set up a strict experiment .
Then the experience is repeatable and others may repeat it afterwards .
Other types of knowledge can be for a more specific purpose , for example learning a language .
In business , computers help to record and share what employees know .
Knowledge in religion is different in that it depends on faith , belief and the authority of religious leaders , not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind .
There are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge .
In many expressions of Christianity , such as Catholicism and Anglicanism , knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit .
In Islam , knowledge -LRB- Arabic : Ø Ù Ù
, Ê ilm -RRB- is given great significance .
`` The All-Knowing '' -LRB- al - Ê AlÄ `` m -RRB- is one of the Names of God reflecting distinct properties of God in Islam .
The Qur ` an asserts that knowledge comes from God and various hadith encourage getting knowledge .
Muhammad is reported to have said `` Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave '' and `` Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets '' .
Islamic scholars , theologians and jurists are often given the title alim , meaning ` knowledgeable ' .
Kauai -LRB- Kaua ` i in Hawaiian -RRB- is the oldest and fourth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands , in the United States .
Known also as the `` Garden Isle '' , Kaua ` i lies 105 miles -LRB- 170 kilometers -RRB- across the Kaua ` i Channel , northwest of Honolulu on O'ahu .
It is of volcanic origin .
The highest point is Mount Waialeale , at the center of the island , 5,148 feet -LRB- 1,570 meters -RRB- above sea level .
The wettest spot on Earth , with average rainfall of 460 inches -LRB- 11,648 millimeters -RRB- a year , is just east of Mount Waialeale .
The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountain .
It has made canyons with many scenic waterfalls .
The city of Lihue , on the island 's southeast side , is the seat of Kauai County .
It is the main city on the island .
Waimea , on the island 's southwest side and once the capital of Kauai , was the first place visited by explorer Captain James Cook in 1778 .
The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world , Waimea Canyon , whose gorge is 900 meters -LRB- 3,000 feet -RRB- deep .
The island of Kauai was featured in Disney 's 2002 animated feature film Lilo & Stitch .
The act of killing a living thing can be said to have happened when an outside force , usually another life form , has done something to cause it to die .
When a human being is killed by the action or fault of another human being , this event is called a homicide .
When a human being is killed by the action of himself -LRB- or herself -RRB- , it is called a suicide .
A kill is also the act of shooting down a fighter aircraft .
Also the word kill is very serious , it means that someone might soon meet his death if he is not careful .
People who kill others are called murderers .
The kilometre is the common unit of longer distances on Earth .
The SI unit is the metre and a kilometre is 1000 metres .
It is now used more often than miles for measuring road distance .
It is also more used more often than the nautical mile for sea distances and air distances .
However in the UK and the USA , the mile is used more than kilometres .
It is often used to measure the speed of cars , planes and boats by saying how many kilometres it can travel in an hour .
This is shown as km\/h .
It is also spelled kilometer .
This spelling is used in American English .
One kilometre is 0.6214 miles -LRB- 3280.84 feet -RRB- .
This means that one mile is 1.6093 kilometres .
Language is the normal way humans communicate .
Looking at all animals , only humans use language , though many other animals communicate in different ways .
An important difference is that human language has syntax , which is a set of rules for connecting words together to make statements and questions ; some other animals use syntax , but it is not as complicated as human syntax .
Language can also be changed , by adding new words , for example , to describe new things .
This is very uncommon in other animals .
Language may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make signs .
It follows that language is not just any way of communicating .
Even some human communication is not language .
Humans also use language for thinking .
Language is a word that may be used by extension : 1 .
The language of a community or country .
2 .
The faculty of speech .
3 .
Formal language in mathematics , logic and computing , such as Cobol or Fortran .
4 .
Sign language for people who can not hear .
5 .
A type of school subject .
All languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication .
: sentences with two types of expression : nouns and verbs : Jill is here .
: adjectives to modify nouns : good food .
: ways of linking : sink or swim .
: dummy elements : Jill likes to swim , so do I. : devices to order or ask questions : Get up !
Are you ill ?
There are many more things in common between languages .
The capacity to learn and use language is inherited .
Normally , all humans are born with this capability .
Which language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the child 's community .
The capacity is inherited , but the particular language is learned .
Children have a special period , from about 18 months to about four years , which is critical for learning the language .
If this is seriously disrupted , then their language skills will be damaged .
Adults do not learn languages the same way they did when they were young .
So if they learn a second language , it is difficult , and they have little chance of speaking it as weell as their native language .
Some children have more than one native language like when they live in a foreign country or when their father speaks a different language from their mother .
Mathematics and computer science use created languages called formal languages -LRB- like computer programming languages -RRB- , but these may or may not be ` true ' languages .
Mathematics itself is seen as a language by many .
Some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language .
Chinese is the language with the most native speakers in the world , but Chinese is not really a language .
It is a close family of dialects , some of which are as different as Romance languages are from one another .
English is often called `` the international language '' .
It is the main second language of the world and the language of science , business , and entertainment .
Some languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them , without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place .
One of the most popular of these languages is Esperanto , which is sometimes called `` La Internacia Lingvo , '' or `` The International Language . ''
Another of these languages is called Volapuk , which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now .
It has mostly been replaced by languages like Esperanto , Interlingua , and Ido .
Part of the reason that Volapuk became unpopular is that some sounds are hard to say for people who speak Spanish or English , two of the most widely spoken languages in the world .
Leisure -LRB- or free time -RRB- is when a person can choose what to do .
During a person 's leisure time , they do not have an obligation to be at school or work at a job .
During leisure time , people can do fun activities , family activities , or other non-work activity , such as hobbies .
A vacation or holiday is the setting aside of time specifically for leisure .
During their vacation , some people travel to a different region or country , and stay at a hotel so that they can do things they could not do near home .
Other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community .
In wealthy industrialized countries such as the US , Canada , and Britain , workers are allowed to stay home on the weekend -LRB- usually Saturday and Sunday -RRB- , and use it as leisure time .
People in poorer developing countries usually have less leisure time , as they have to work longer hours and more days per year .
Life is mainly a biological idea that has no simple definition .
The study of life is called biology and people who study life are biologists .
A lifespan is the average length of life in a species .
All life is directly or indirectly powered by solar energy .
Without energy from the sun no life could exist .
All known life on Earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds .
Some say that this must be true for all possible forms of life throughout the Universe ; others describe this position as `` carbon chauvinism '' .
Currently , the Earth is the only planet in the Universe known to have things living on it .
The question of whether life exists elsewhere in the Universe remains open .
There have been a number of false alarms of life elsewhere in the Universe , but none of these apparent discoveries have so far been confirmed .
The best evidence of life outside of Earth is fossil evidence of possible bacterial life on Mars .
One explanation of life is called the cell theory .
The cell theory has three basic points : All living things are made of cells .
The cell is the smallest living thing that can do all the things needed for life .
All cells must come from preexisting cells .
However , there are a few exceptions to these rules .
Because this definition is not exact , it could be said that :
Many organisms are not able to reproduce and yet are still generally considered to be `` alive '' ; see mule and ant for examples .
However , these exceptions can be covered by defining life at the level of entire species or of individual genes -LRB- for example , see kin selection for one way that non-reproducing individuals can still enhance the spread of their genes and the survival of their species -RRB- .
The thermodynamic definition of life is any system which can keep its entropy levels below maximum -LRB- usually through adaptation and mutations -RRB- .
Death is the end of life in a living system , or in a part of it .
Life insurances , including pensions and life annuities , provide payments depending on life or death of a particular person .
Because of this , documents that may be required for payment are :
The law is a set of rules that people are supposed to follow in a society or a country .
The courts and police enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws , such as by making them pay a fine or other penalty or sending them to jail .
In ancient societies , laws were written by leaders , to set out rules on how people can live , work and do business with each other .
Today in most countries , laws are written and voted on by groups of elected politicians in a legislature , such as a parliament or congress .
To follow the laws of a society is to do legal things .
An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws .
A legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced .
This may deal with things like police , courts , or punishments .
A lawyer or jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law .
In the United States , there are two kinds of attorneys - `` transactional '' attorneys who write contracts and `` litigators '' who go to court .
The Rule of Law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on .
It limits the powers a government has , as agreed in a country 's constitution .
The Rule of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people .
When leaders enforce the legal code honestly , even on themselves and their friends , this is an example of the rule of law being followed .
`` The rule of law '' , wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC , `` is better than the rule of any individual . ''
Culture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws , as people tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits .
In many countries throughout history , religion and religious books like the Vedas , Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law .
Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today .
Civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government .
The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom .
In civil law governments , judges do not generally have much power , and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by members of parliament .
Common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases .
It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire , except Scotland , and the Canadian province of Quebec .
It is also the predominant form of law in the United States , where many laws called statutes are written by Congress , but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts .
Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages , when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the Magna Carta .
Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books .
Examples include the Jewish Halakha , Islamic Sharia , and Christian Canon law .
Until the 1700s , Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world .
In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran , the whole legal systems still base their law in Sharia law .
Religious law is often criticized by countries that are not ruled by a religious government , because it often has very harsh penalties for very minor crimes , and often results in the mistreatment of women and minorities .
The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilisations .
Ancient Egyptian law developed in 3000 BC .
In 1760 BC King Hammurabi , took ancient Babylonian law and organized it , and then had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace .
These laws became known as the Code of Hammurabi .
The Torah from the Old Testament is probably the oldest body of law .
It was written around 1280 BC .
It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments , which tell people what things are not permitted .
The judiciary is a group of judges who resolve people 's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty .
Most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts , up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court .
The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional -LRB- which go against the constitution -RRB- .
In democracies , the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature .
Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London , the Congress in Washington , D.C. , the Bundestag in Berlin , the Duma in Moscow and the AssemblÃ e nationale in Paris .
Most legislatures have two chambers or houses , a ` lower house ' and an ` upper house ' .
To pass legislation , a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house .
The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws , and votes on whether they will be approved .
The executive is the governing center of political authority .
In most democratic countries , the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature .
This group of elected people is called the cabinet .
In France , the US and Russia , the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature .
The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries .
As well , the executive usually controls the military , the police , and the bureaucracy .
The executive selects ministers , or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice .
The police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law .
Bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government .
Bureaucrats work within a system of rules , and they make their decisions in writing .
Lawyers are people who have learned about laws .
Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court .
To become a lawyer , a person has to complete a two - or three-year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination .
Lawyers work in a law firms , for the government , for companies , or by themselves .
Civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights .
Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties , debating clubs , trade unions , human rights organizations , newspapers , and charities .
Canada 's land is composed of thirteen parts : ten provinces and three territories .
Canada is governed on the principles of a federation : the Provinces ' governments share power with the Government of Canada -LRB- the federal government -RRB- .
The territories ' governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces ' .
The provinces are located in the south of Canada , and the territories are in the north , where fewer people live .
Here is a list of the provinces , and their standard abbreviations , with their capitals -LRB- the cities where their governments have their offices -RRB- .
Canada 's capital city is Ottawa .
Las Vegas is a city in the American state of Nevada .
The city has a population of 567,641 people in 2009 .
It is the biggest city in Nevada .
Las Vegas is also the county seat of Clark County in Nevada .
Mormon farmers first lived there in 1854 .
It was called Las Vegas by Spanish people .
I , Katha McGowan moved here in 1961 .
The name means The Meadows in the Spanish language .
It had a lot of these in 1854 .
The city is known for its dry climate , as is the rest of Southern Nevada .
It is surrounded by deserts .
The US Army built Fort Baker there in 1864 .
Las Vegas has springs so people used to stop there for water when they were going to Los Angeles or other places in California .
In 1905 , 110 acres owned by William A. Clark , on which he built a railroad to Southern California were auctioned and Las Vegas was founded as a railroad town .
Las Vegas officially became a city in 1911 .
Las Vegas , also known by a shorter name , Vegas , is notable for its liberal policies on activities such as drinking and gambling .
Gambling was made legal in the state of Nevada in 1931 .
In 1941 , many hotels were built in Las Vegas with casinos in them .
Las Vegas is sometimes called `` Sin City '' because so many people come to the city for gambling and drinking alcohol , two common `` sins '' .
People come to Las Vegas for vacation , many hotels have different themes and have shows and events to get people to come there .
Because of this , Las Vegas is called `` The Entertainment Capital of the World '' .
Las Vegas is also known for its many casinos , decorated with various bright colors .
Some of these casinos include Circus Circus , a circus-themed casino , and The Venetian , an Italian-themed casino .
A leap year comes once every four years .
It is a year in which an extra day is added to the Gregorian calendar which is used by most of the world .
An ordinary year has 365 days .
A leap year has 366 days .
The extra day is added to the month of February .
In an ordinary year , February has 28 days .
In a leap year , it has 29 days .
This extra day is called a leap day .
In a leap year , January , April , and July , all start on the same day of the week .
In a leap year , February starts and ends on the same day .
A leap year can always be evenly divided by four .
For example , 2008 is a leap year .
But a year is not a leap year if it can be evenly divided by 100 , but can not also be evenly divided by 400 .
This is why 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 are not leap years , but 2000 was .
We have leap years because instead of 365 days , the Earth really takes a few minutes less than 365-1\/4 days -LRB- 365.24219 -RRB- to go completely around the Sun .
Without leap years , the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years .
After 360 years , spring -LRB- which usually begins on March 21 -RRB- would begin on December 21 -LRB- which is when winter presently begins -RRB- .
A number of countries use a lunar calendar -LRB- based on the moon -RRB- .
They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month .
Different calendars add the extra month in different ways .
Leather is the skin of an animal , used as a material .
The skins of cows , pigs , and goats are often used to make leather .
Skins of snakes , alligators or crocodiles , and ostriches are sometimes used to make fancier leather .
Shoes , bags , clothes , and balls are often made of leather .
Sometimes people make leather out of whales , ducks , giraffes , and African elephants , but all of these ways of making leather are very simple but can also be very hard and rare sometimes .
A license allows a person or company to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do .
In British English , the spelling is licence .
A person usually has to pay some money to get a license .
A license is usually written but it does not have to be .
There are many different types of licenses .
The laws of most countries say that people are only allowed to drive cars if they have a license .
If a person does not have a license , they may have to pay a fine if they are caught by the police .
In many country , a person must take a test and pay money to get a license .
Other licenses give permission to shoot animals -LRB- often called a hunting license -RRB- .
The hunting license usually says when a person may hunt .
In the United Kingdom and Ireland , if someones has a television set , they must buy a `` television licence '' every year .
A person or a company can also give a license to a patent , copyright , or trademark that they own .
In those cases , the government has said that the owner may stop other people from using their rights .
So in order for another person to use an owner 's patent , copyright , or trademark , they need permission from the owner .
For example , when someone buys a computer software application , they also need a license from the creator of the software -LRB- a copyright owner -RRB- allowing the buyer to use the software .
In many countries , if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it , he might have to pay a fine or go to prison .
`` License '' is a verb .
`` Licensing sessions '' were the meetings of magistrates which decided about giving licences to sell alcohol .
In American English spelling there is no difference in spelling between the verb `` to license '' meaning to give permission , and the noun `` a licence '' meaning the permission to do something .
A library is a place where many books are kept .
Most libraries are public and let people take the books to use in their home .
Most libraries let people borrow books for several weeks .
Some belong to institutions , for example , companies , churches , schools , and universities .
Also a person 's bookshelves at home can have many books and be a library .
The people who work in libraries are librarians .
Other libraries keep famous or rare books .
There are a few `` Copyright libraries '' which have a copy of every book which has been written in that country .
Some libraries also have other things that people might like , such as magazines , music on CDs , or computers where people can use the Internet .
In school they offer software to learn the alphabet and other details .
A library is not a bookstore -LRB- a store that sells books -RRB- .
Many places have a public library , where anybody can join if they live in the area .
With a library card , people can borrow books and take them home for several weeks .
It does not cost money to get a library card at most public libraries .
Books , music , and movies are kept on shelves in a special order so they are easy to find .
Public libraries have stories and books about lots of things .
Many public libraries have books and CDs about learning English .
Stories are kept in alphabetical order by the last name of the person who wrote them , the author .
Books about other things are often given a special number , that refers to what they are about .
They are then put on the shelf in number order .
One number system used by many libraries is the Dewey decimal system .
A librarian is a person who works in a library .
Librarians help people find books and information .
They can teach people how to find books and use the library .
1 .
We can use to like to say that we find a thing is good : : I like my house .
= I think my house is good .
: I like Jenny = I think Jenny is an OK person .
2 .
We can use like for `` the same as '' or `` nearly the same as '' : : This cheese sandwich feels like rubber = the sandwich is difficult to eat , nearly the same as rubber .
: Jenny is like her mother = Jenny has brown hair , and her mother also has brown hair -LRB- for example -RRB- .
: Your pen is like my pen = Your pen and my pen are the same sort .
3 .
We can also use like for `` the same way as '' : : She runs like the wind - she and the wind are both fast .
: She talks like a child - she and children speak slowly or with a high voice .
4 .
In a question , we can use like to ask people to talk about a thing , or to say if they find it good or not : : What 's your house like ?
-LRB- Answer : `` It has two bedrooms and a big kitchen ... '' -RRB- : What was the film like ?
-LRB- Answer : `` It was very good ! '' -RRB-
5 .
We can also use like as `` for example '' : : I often go to other countries , like France or Germany = I go to other countries , for example France and Germany .
6 .
In British and American English young people , when talking , have recently started using like as an extra word in the middle of sentences .
Sometimes they use it to report what someone said , especially when mimicking the way they said it .
This should never be used in writing : : The teacher was like : `` Do n't do that ! ''
As works in the same way as example 2 - comparing two things using either the word `` like '' or the word `` as '' is called making a simile -LRB- As big as an elephant -RRB- .
It may be better to use the word `` as '' for this to stop confusion with example 1 .
Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language , meaning `` those who write the laws . ''
The legislature of a state or country is a group of people , each of whom got his or her office either by winning an election or by being appointed , to vote for the best laws .
The way a legislature is supposed to work can usually be found in the constitution of that state or country .
In many countries , the legislature is called a Parliament or Congress .
Sometimes the legislature is made up of two separate houses .
This is called a `` bicameral '' legislature .
A county , district , city , or other small area also has a council , that makes the rules and laws for its level of government .
The way a council works can usually be found in the area 's charter .
Linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate -LRB- rearrange -RRB- systems of linear equations .
These two equations form a system of linear equations .
It is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power .
The graph of a linear equation is a straight line .
since it makes all of the original equations valid , that is , the value on left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations .
Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior , called a matrix .
For the previous example , the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix .
London is a big city in the South-East of England , on the River Thames .
It is the capital of England and the United Kingdom .
It has a population of 7.5 million people and is by far the largest city in The United Kingdom .
It is also the largest city in Europe .
London was founded by the Romans in 43 AD and called Londinium which was later shortened to London .
London is also known as Lunnainn in Scottish , Llundain in Welsh and Londain in Irish .
For many ages , London was a small city and all its people fitted inside the walls that were built by the Romans .
This area is still called the City of London .
Around the city there were many villages .
Gradually , as more and more people came to live there , the villages joined together into one huge city which is now called `` London '' or Greater London .
Most people in London are English .
However , London also has many migrants , who come from many different countries , speaking different languages and with different religions and cultures .
There are also many people from different countries who stay in London on business .
Many people visit London as tourists , to see the famous `` Sights of London '' which include palaces , churches and museums .
London is one of the World 's most important cities for business , finance , and politics .
It is also important for culture : media , entertainment , fashion , and art .
The Romans built a city called Londinium on the River Thames in AD 43 .
The name Londinium -LRB- and then ` London ' -RRB- came from the Celtic language of the Ancient Britons .
In the year 61 AD , Queen Boudica -LRB- a British Celtic queen -RRB- and her army destroyed the city .
Boudica killed herself when Romans trapped her and the Romans then rebuilt London .
London became an important trading city .
After the Romans left Britain , no-one lived in the city for a long time because the Anglo-Saxons liked living in the countryside .
In the 9th century , people started living there again .
It became the largest city in England , but it did not become the capital city of England until the 12th century .
After the railways were built , London grew very big .
Greater London has 33 London Boroughs and a mayor .
The old City of London is only a square-mile in size but has its own Lord Mayor .
Another famous old part of Greater London is Westminster , which was always a different city from the City of London .
Westminster has Westminster Abbey -LRB- a cathedral -RRB- , The Palace of Westminster -LRB- the Houses of Parliament , with Big Ben -RRB- , and 10 Downing Street -LRB- where the Prime Minister lives -RRB- .
London also has a `` partnership '' agreement with Tokyo , Japan .
A litre -LRB- liter in the United States -RRB- is the metric unit of volume .
One litre is the volume of one cubic decimetre , that is a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 centimetre .
A litre of water has a mass of about one kilogram .
The symbol for litre is L or l.
For smaller volumes the decilitre is used : 10 dl = one litre .
For smaller volumes the millilitre is used : 1000 ml = one litre .
The capital letter `` L '' is preferred by some people as the small `` l '' can look like the number one `` 1 '' .
Mathematics -LRB- sometimes shortened as `` maths '' or `` math '' -RRB- , is the study of numbers , shapes and patterns .
Mathematicians are people who learn about and discover such things in mathematics .
Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world , so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics .
Today , mathematics is needed in many jobs .
Business , science , engineering , and construction need some knowledge of mathematics .
Mathematicians solve problems by using logic .
Mathematicians often use deduction .
Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths .
To a mathematician , the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true .
Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking .
Mathematics uses logic to study these things and to create general rules , which are an important part of mathematics .
These rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations .
By finding general rules , mathematics solves many problems at the same time .
A proof gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct .
This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct , which are called axioms .
A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a theorem .
Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems .
Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it .
That idea is called a conjecture until they find a proof .
Sometimes , mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we do n't understand yet .
Often in mathematics , ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or beautiful .
On the other hand , sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics ; this has happened many times in the past .
In general , studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better .
Mathematics includes the study of number , or quantity .
Some areas of mathematics study the structure that an object has .
Some areas of mathematics study the shapes of things .
Some areas of mathematics study the way things change .
Applied mathematics uses mathematics to solve problems of other areas such as engineering , physics , and computing .
These theorems have interested mathematicians and people who are not mathematicians .
These are theorems and conjectures that have greatly changed mathematics .
Progress in understanding the nature of mathematics also influences the way mathematicians study their subject .
Mathematics in history , and the history of mathematics .
The word `` mathematics '' comes from the Greek word '' Î 1\/4 Î Î Î Î 1\/4 Î '' -LRB- mÃ thema -RRB- .
The Greek word '' Î 1\/4 Î Î Î Î 1\/4 Î '' means `` science , knowledge , or learning '' .
Often , the word `` mathematics '' is made shorter into maths -LRB- in British English -RRB- or math -LRB- in American English -RRB- .
The short words math or maths are often used for arithmetic , geometry or simple algebra by young students and their schools .
There is no Nobel prize in mathematics .
Mathematicians can receive the Abel prize and the Fields Medal for important works .
Tools that are used to do mathematics or find answers to mathematics problems .
March is the third month of the year .
It has 31 days .
March is named after Mars , the Roman god of war .
In ancient Rome , March was called Martius .
It was named after the war god -LRB- Mars -RRB- and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war .
March 's flower is the jonquil and its birthstone is the bloodstone .
The meaning of the bloodstone is courage .
May is the fifth month of the year .
It has 31 days .
The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia , or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea , whose festival was held in May .
May 's flower is the Lily of the Valley .
Its birthstone is the emerald .
The meaning of the emerald is success in love .
Music is an art that puts sounds together in a way that people like or find interesting .
Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments , such as the piano , guitar , or drums .
The word music comes from the Greek word Greek language Î 1\/4 Î Ï
Ï Î Î Î -LRB- mousike -RRB- , which means '' -LRB- art -RRB- of the Muses '' .
In Ancient Greece the Muses included the goddesses of music , poetry , art , and dance .
Someone who makes music is called a musician .
Music is sound that has been organized by using rhythm , melody or harmony .
If someone bangs saucepans while cooking , it makes noise .
If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way , they are making a simple type of music .
Blues music is music that is played by singing , using the harmonica , or the acoustic guitar .
Jazz musicians use instruments such as the trumpet and saxophone -LRB- formerly clarinet -RRB- .
Music started many thousands of years ago .
When early people first banged pieces of wood together and enjoyed the sound , they were discovering music .
Early people also discovered that when they cut off the horns of animals they had killed and blew through them , they could make interesting sounds .
People also blew into conch shells and made sounds that they liked .
They probably started to sing or shout in celebration .
Even in the stone age people made music .
The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally .
Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns , repetition and tonality .
Even today , this kind of music still exists .
Shamans sometimes imitate sounds that occur naturally .
It may also serve as entertainment -LRB- games -RRB- , or have practical uses , like luring animals when hunting .
Music may not be something that is limited to humans .
Birds use sounds to defend their territory , or to attract a mate .
Monkeys have been seen beating hollow logs .
This may of course also serve to defend the territory .
The first musical instrument used by humans may have been their voice .
The human voice can make many different kinds of sounds , like singing , humming and whistling through to clicking , coughing and yawning .
The oldest known Neanderthal hyoid bone with the modern human form has been dated to be 60,000 years old .
The oldest known bone flute is 10.000 years younger .
Both are unique , it is therefore difficult to say when music really started .
Most likely the first rhythm instruments or percussion instruments involved the clapping of hands , stones hit together , or other things that are useful to create rhythm .
There are finds of this type that date back to the paleolithic .
Some of these are ambiguous , as they can be used either as a tool or a musical instrument .
Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes ; paleolithic finds which are open to interpretation are pierced phalanges -LRB- finger bones -RRB- , objects interpreted as bullroarers , and rasps .
Music may have arisen amongst humans when stone tools first began to be used by hominids .
This would put it in the Oldowan era of the Paleolithic .
The noises produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal is a possible source of rhythm created by early humans .
The oldest flute ever discovered may be the so-called Divje Babe flute , found in the Slovenian cave Divje Babe I in 1995 .
It is not certain that the object is really a flute .
The item in question is a fragment of the femur of a young cave bear , and has been dated to about 43,000 years ago .
However , whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivore-chewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate .
In 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm , Germany .
The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone .
The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal Nature , in June 2009 .
The discovery is also the oldest confirmed find of any musical instrument in history .
Other flutes were also found in the cave .
This flute was found next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving .
When they announced their discovery , the scientists suggested that the `` finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe '' .
Scientists have also suggested that the discovery of the flute may help to explain why early humans survived , while Neanderthals became extinct .
The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near Greystones , Ireland , in 2004 .
A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood , between 30 and 50cm long , tapered at one end , but without any finger holes .
They may once have been strapped together .
In 1986 several bone flutes were found in Jiahu in Henan Province , China .
They date to about 6,000 BC .
They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird , the red-crowned crane .
At the time of the discovery , one was found to be still playable .
The bone flute plays both the five - or seven-note scale of Xia Zhi and six-note scale of Qing Shang of the ancient Chinese musical system .
It is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like .
Some architecture , even some paintings , are thousands of years old , but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down .
The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments , or by finding them in archaeological digs -LRB- digging under the ground to find old things -RRB- .
The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in Hurrian , a language spoken in and around northern Mesopotamia -LRB- where Iraq is today -RRB- , from about 1500 BC .
Another early piece of written music that has survived was a round called Sumer Is Icumen In .
It was written down by a monk around the year 1250 .
Much of the music in the Middle Ages -LRB- roughly 450-1420 -RRB- was folk music played by working people who wanted to sing or dance .
When people played instruments , they were usually playing for dancers .
However , most of the music that was written down was for the Catholic church .
This music was written for monks to sing in church .
It is called Chant -LRB- or Gregorian chant -RRB- .
In the Renaissance -LRB- roughly 1400-1550 -RRB- there was a lot of music , and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed , played or sung today .
The name for this period -LRB- Renaissance -RRB- is a French word which means `` rebirth '' .
This period was called the `` rebirth '' because many new types of art and music were reborn during this time .
Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services -LRB- sacred music -RRB- by the Italian composer Giovanni da Palestrina -LRB- 1525-1594 -RRB- .
In Palestrina 's music , many singers sing together -LRB- this is called a choir -RRB- .
There was also plenty of music not written for the church , such as happy dance music and romantic love songs .
Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the viols -LRB- a string instrument played with a bow -RRB- , lutes -LRB- a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a guitar -RRB- , and the virginal , a small , quiet keyboard instrument .
In the arts , the Baroque was a Western cultural era , which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome .
It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture , painting , literature , dance , and music -LRB- 1 -RRB- .
-LRB- citation needed -RRB- In music , the term ` Baroque ' applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint , where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches , sometimes inverting the echo , and even reversing thematic material .
The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement .
-LRB- citation needed -RRB- The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control .
Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts , grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence .
In similar profusions of detail , art , music , architecture , and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement -LRB- citation needed -RRB- as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns .
Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details , often bright polychromy , less realistic faces of subjects , and an overall sense of awe , which was one of the goals in Baroque art .
The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun `` barroco '' -LRB- citation needed -RRB- which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape .
Hence , in informal usage , the word baroque can simply mean that something is `` elaborate '' , with many details , without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
The Classical period is about -LRB- 1750-1825 -RRB- .
Sometimes `` classical music '' is used to mean any art music that is not `` pop music '' , but in the History of Music , the term `` classical music '' means music from the late 1700s and the first years of the 1800s .
This was a time when people became very interested in ancient Roman and Greek art -LRB- often called the `` classics '' -RRB- .
In music , it was the time of composers like Joseph Haydn , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , and Ludwig van Beethoven .
Orchestras became bigger , and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called symphonies that had several sections -LRB- called movements -RRB- .
Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast ; other movements were quiet and sad .
The form of a piece of music was very important at this time and becoming very popular .
Music had to have a nice shape .
They often used a structure which was called sonata form .
Another important type of music was the string quartet , which is a piece of music written for two violins , a viola , and a violoncello .
Like symphonies , string quartet music had several sections .
Haydn , Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets .
The piano was invented during this time .
Composers liked the piano , because it could be used to play dynamics -LRB- getting louder or getting softer -RRB- .
Other popular instruments included the violin , the violoncello , the flute , the clarinet , and the oboe .
Joseph Hadyn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were so powerful in their music that they influenced the western style of music .
The 19th century is called the Romantic period .
Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music .
An important instrument from the Romantic period was the piano .
Some composers , such as Frederic Chopin wrote subdued , expressive , quietly emotional piano pieces .
Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds .
Other composers , such as Franz Schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied -LRB- the German word for `` song '' -RRB- .
These Lieder -LRB- plural of Lied -RRB- told stories by using the lyrics -LRB- words -RRB- of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniments .
Other composers , like Richard Strauss , and Franz Liszt created narratives and told stories using only music , which is called a tone poem .
Composers , such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms used the piano to play loud , dramatic , strongly emotional music .
Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras , with as many as 100 instruments .
It was the period of `` Nationalism '' -LRB- the feeling of being proud of one 's country -RRB- when many composers made music using folksong or melodies from their country .
Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as Franz Schubert , Felix Mendelssohn , Frederic Chopin , Johannes Brahms , Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner .
From about 1900 onwards is called the `` modern period '' .
Many 20th century composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music .
Modern composers searched for new ideas , such as using new instruments , different forms , different sounds , or different harmonies .
The composer Arnold Schoenberg -LRB- 1874-1951 -RRB- wrote pieces which were atonal -LRB- meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key -RRB- .
Later , Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called twelve-tone system .
Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange to some , but is mathematical in nature , often making sense only after careful study .
Pure twelve-tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties , but some composers such as Benjamin Britten use it today , when it is necessary to get a certain feel .
Igor Stravinsky -LRB- 1882-1971 -RRB- wrote music with very complicated -LRB- difficult -RRB- chords -LRB- groups of notes that are played together -RRB- and rhythms .
Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalist pieces which use very simple ideas .
In the 1950s and 1960s , composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic music , using electronic circuits , amplifiers and loudspeakers .
In the 1970s , composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music , such as the electric guitar .
They used these new instruments to make new sounds .
Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s , such as John Adams -LRB- born 1947 -RRB- and James MacMillan -LRB- born 1959 -RRB- often use a mixture of all these ideas , but they like to write tonal music with easy tunes as well .
Jazz is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in New Orleans in the south of the USA .
There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called blues music .
Blues music was influenced by African music -LRB- because the black people in the United States had come to the United States as slaves .
They were taken from Africa by force -RRB- .
Blues music was a music that was played by singing , using the harmonica , or the acoustic guitar .
Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions -LRB- feelings -RRB- or sad experiences , such as losing a job , a family member dying , or having to go to jail -LRB- prison -RRB- .
Jazz music mixed together blues music with European music .
Some black composers such as Scott Joplin were writing music called ragtime , which had a very different rhythm from standard European music , but used notes that were similar to some European music .
Ragtime was a big influence on early jazz , called Dixieland jazz .
Jazz musicians used instruments such as the trumpet , saxophone , and clarinet were used for the tunes -LRB- melodies -RRB- , drums for percussion and plucked double bass , piano , banjo and guitar for the background rhythm -LRB- rhythmic section -RRB- .
Jazz is usually improvised : the players make up -LRB- invent -RRB- the music as they play .
Even though jazz musicians are making up the music , jazz music still has rules ; the musicians play a series of chords -LRB- groups of notes -RRB- in order .
Jazz music has a swinging rhythm .
The word `` swing '' is hard to explain .
For a rhythm to be a `` swinging rhythm '' it has to feel natural and relaxed .
Swing rhythm is not even like a march .
There is a long-short feel instead of a same-same feel .
A `` swinging rhythm '' also gets the people who are listening excited , because they like the sound of it .
Some people say that a `` swinging rhythm '' happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song .
If a jazz band plays very well together , people will say `` that is a swinging jazz band '' or `` that band really swings well . ''
Jazz influenced other types of music like the Western art music from the 1920s and 1930s .
Art music composers such as George Gershwin wrote music that was influenced by jazz .
Jazz music influenced pop music songs .
In the 1930s and 1940s , many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs .
One of the best known jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong -LRB- 1900-1971 -RRB- .
`` Pop '' music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to .
The term `` pop music '' can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular .
The word `` pop music '' was used from about 1880 onwards , when a type of music called music was popular .
Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll , -LRB- for example Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley and Little Richard -RRB- and rockabilly -LRB- for example Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly -RRB- .
In the 1960s , The Beatles became a famous pop music group .
In the 1970s , other styles of music were mixed with pop music , such as funk and soul music .
Pop music generally has a heavy -LRB- strong -RRB- beat , so that it is good for dancing .
Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker .
`` Musical notation '' means `` the way music is written down '' .
It is very useful to be able to read and write music because this is how composers -LRB- who may have lived a long time ago -RRB- can tell the person playing their music how they want their music to be played .
Music is written on five parallel lines called a staff .
Notes are put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines .
It can be seen from the shape whether the music goes up or down .
The lengths of the notes -LRB- how long they are played for -RRB- are shown by making the note-heads black or white , and by giving them stems and flags .
Reading music involves being able to tell what the note is called and where to find it on the instrument , and being able imagine the sound , as well as learning about music theory -LRB- how music works : all about scales , intervals , ornaments , form , etc -RRB- .
This all helps someone to become a good musician .
It is also useful to be able to play `` by ear '' -LRB- when people try to play music they have only heard -RRB- .
Most rock musicians , blues musicians , and folk musicians play `` by ear . ''
This means that to learn a song , they listen to other people singing it , or to a recording , until they know how the tune of the song goes .
People can enjoy music by listening to it .
They can go to concerts to hear musicians perform .
Classical music is usually performed in concert halls , but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside , in a field or stadium , like pop festivals .
People can listen to music on CDs , Computers , iPods , television , the radio , cassette\/record-players and even mobile phones .
There is so much music today , in elevators , shopping malls , and stores , that it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear .
Sometimes it is good to listen more closely to music : by trying to hear the different instruments and what types of notes the instruments are playing .
People can learn to play an instrument such as the piano , the guitar , the bass , the trumpet , the drums , or the tuba .
They must choose an instrument that is practical for their size .
For example , a very short child can not play a full size double bass , because the double bass is over five feet high .
People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing , because playing regularly is the only way to get better .
Finally , it helps to have a good teacher .
Anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music .
It is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies -LRB- tunes -RRB- .
It 's easier for people who can play an instrument themselves .
All it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes .
Someone can make up a piece that tells a story , or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated .
The instrument might be someone 's own voice .
Madrid -LRB- pronounced : â mah-DRID â or \/ mÉ Ë drÉ d \/ -RRB- is the capital and largest city of Spain .

Montreal is built on an island sitting in the Saint Lawrence River .
More than three million people live in the Montreal region .
At the center of Montreal is a mountain called Mount Royal .
Most of the people who live in Montreal speak French , but English is commonly spoken as well .
The origin of the name ` MontrÃ al ' is derived from Mons realis , which means ` Mount Royal ' in latin .
Montreal has always played a very important part in the history and development of Canada , and continues to be a large Canadian industrial and commercial center , as well as a major sea port -LRB- via the Saint Lawrence River -RRB- .
It once was the largest city in Canada , before Toronto grew to be larger .
Montreal is a very historical and culturally interesting place for visitors .
One can visit the Old City in horse drawn carriages , where many buildings from the earliest years are standing proud , all of which is a constant reminder -LRB- and source of inspiration -RRB- to describe a lot about the way of life that started in the New World , when Montreal was just a fur trading outpost belonging to France over 350 years ago .

Maui is part of Maui County , Hawaii .
The larger -LRB- or better known -RRB- towns include Kahului , Wailuku , Lahaina , Hana , and Wailea .
Main industries are agriculture and tourism .
Maui was named for the demi-god Maui .
In Hawaiian legend , he raised all the islands from the sea .
Maui is also known as the `` Valley Isle '' for the large fertile isthmus -LRB- narrow land connection -RRB- between two volcanoes .
Maui is a volcanic doublet : an island formed from two volcanic mountains that are joined together .
The older volcano , Mauna Kahalawai , is much older and has been very worn down .
In common talk it is called the West Maui Mountain .
The larger volcano , Haleakala , rises above 10,000 feet -LRB- 3,050 m -RRB- .
The last eruption of Haleakala happened over 200 years ago , and this lava flow can be seen between Ahihi Bay and La Perouse Bay on the southeast shore .
Money is what people use to buy things and `` services '' -LRB- that is , to have things done for them -RRB- - and what they take for selling their own things or services -LRB- what they do for others -RRB- .
There are many kinds of money in the world .
Most countries have their own kind of money , such as the United States dollar or the British pound .
Money is also called many other names , like currency or cash .
Most of the time a state or a government prints paper money and makes coins at a special place called a mint .
Money is what you use to buy things .
The idea of trading things is very old .
A long time ago , people did not buy or sell with money .
Instead , they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed .
One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who owned much wheat .
Each would trade a little of what he had with the other , and support the people on his farm .
This is known as barter .
Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable , and were used as trade items , such as jewelry and spices .
When people changed from trading in things like cows and wheat to using money instead , they needed things that would last a long time , still be valuable , and could be carried around .
The first country in the world to make metal coins was called Lydia , sometime around 650 BC , in the western part of what is now Turkey .
The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion .
This idea soon spread to Greece , the rest of the Mediterranean , and the rest of the world .
Coins were all made to the same size and shape .
In some parts of the world , different things have been used as money , like clam shells or blocks of salt .
Besides being easier to carry than cows , using money had many other advantages .
Money is easier to divide than many trade goods .
If someone own cows , and wants to trade for only `` half a cow 's worth '' of wheat , he probably does not want to cut his cow in half .
But if he sells his cow for money , and buys wheat with money , he can get exactly the amount he wants .
Cows die , and wheat rots .
But money lasts longer than most trade goods .
If someone sells a cow for money , he can save that money away until he needs it .
He can always leave it to his children when he dies .
It can last a very long time , and he can use it at any time .
Not every cow is as good as another cow .
Some cows are sick and old , and others are healthy and young .
Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale .
So if a person trades cows for wheat , he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth .
But money is standard .
That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar .
It is easier to add up and count money , than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat .
Later , after coins had been used for hundreds of years , paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin , much like an `` I.O.U. '' note .
The first true paper money was used in China between 600 and 1455 , and paper money was also printed in Sweden between 1660 and 1664 .
Both times , it did not work well , and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes .
Massachusetts Bay Colony printed paper money in the 1690s , and this time , the use became more common .
Today , most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold .
It is numbers in bank accounts , saved in computer memories .
A large number of people still feel more comfortable using coins and paper , and do not totally trust using electronic money on a computer memory .
Many types of money have been used at different times in history .
These are :
Commodity money can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange .
We say it possesses intrinsic value , because it is useful or valuable by itself .
Some examples of commodity money are cattle , silk , gold and silver .
Convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver .
Gold and Silver certificates are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver .
Inconvertible money is money that can not be converted into gold and silver .
Notes and coins are inconvertible money .
They are incovertible and are declared by the government money .
They are also a country 's legal tender .
Today , notes and coins are the currencies used in df the money used is bank deposits .
Multiplication is an arithmetic operation for finding the product of two numbers .
Multiplication is the third operation in maths after addition which is the first , subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication .
With natural numbers , it tells you the number of tiles in a rectangle where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the neighbouring side .
With real numbers , it tells you the area of a rectangle where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the neighbouring side .
For example , three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together , or the total of three fives .
This can be written down as 3 Ã -- 5 = 15 , or spoken as `` three times five equals fifteen . ''
Mathematicians call the two numbers you wish to multiply `` coefficients '' together , or `` multiplicand '' and `` multiplicator '' separately .
Multiplicand Ã -- multiplicator = product .
Multiplication between numbers is said to be commutative - when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product .
This is true for the Integers -LRB- whole numbers -RRB- , e.g. 4 Ã -- 6 is the same as 6 Ã -- 4 , and also for the Rational numbers -LRB- fractions -RRB- , and for all the other Real numbers -LRB- representable as a field in the continuous line -RRB- , and also for Complex numbers -LRB- numbers representable as a field in the plane -RRB- .
It is not true for quaternions -LRB- numbers representable as a ring in the four-dimensional space -RRB- , vectors or matrices .
The opposite of multiplication is division .
Microsoft Corporation is a very big company which makes computer software and videogames all over the world .
Bill Gates and Paul Allen started the company in 1975 .
Microsoft makes Windows , Microsoft Office -LRB- including Microsoft Word -RRB- , Internet Explorer , MSN , and the Xbox 360 .
These are just the most popular products - they make a lot of other ones too .
Most Microsoft programs can not be downloaded for free - people have to buy them in a shop or online .
Some products -LRB- like the Windows operating system -RRB- are already installed when people buy a new computer .
Windows is a popular Microsoft product .
It is an operating system , which means that it is the basic software that makes people 's computers work and lets other programs work .
Most computers have some kind of Windows , like Windows XP or Windows Vista .
Microsoft Office is also very popular , and it lets people write documents on their computer with Microsoft Word , make charts and graphs with Microsoft Excel , make presentations with Microsoft PowerPoint , and do many other things .
Internet Explorer lets people look at things on the Internet .
Microsoft makes other programs on the Internet .
A lot of it is called `` Windows Live '' - `` service '' , with the name `` Windows Live '' put in front of the name of the service , like Windows Live Hotmail .
The Xbox and the new Xbox 360 are videogame `` consoles '' , which means they let people play videogames on their TV .
Microsoft is one of three big companies that make consoles .
The other two are Nintendo and Sony .
Xbox Live lets people play online against other people anywhere in the world .
Microsoft also makes many PC games .
A multiverse -LRB- or meta-universe -RRB- is the theory of a set of multiple possible universes , including our universe , which make up reality .
These universes are sometimes called parallel universes .
It is believed by some physicists that our universe is perfect for life , because it had thousands of other chances at life , each of which is a different universe in the multiverse .
The term `` multiverse '' was coined by psychologist William James .
MediaWiki is the name of the software that runs all of the Wikimedia projects .
MediaWiki was released in 2003 .
The software is licensed under the GPL .
This means it is free content , or open source .
MediaWiki is free server-based software which is licensed under the GNU General Public License -LRB- GPL -RRB- .
It is designed to be run on a large server farm for a website that gets millions of hits per day .
MediaWiki is a very powerful , scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation , that uses PHP to process and display data stored in its MySQL database .
Pages use MediaWiki 's Wikitext format , so that users without knowledge of XHTML or CSS can edit them easily .
When a user submits an edit to a page , MediaWiki writes it to the database , but without deleting the previous versions of the page , thus allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming .
MediaWiki can manage image and multimedia files , too , which are stored in the filesystem .
For large wikis with lots of users , MediaWiki supports caching and can be easily coupled with Squid proxy server software .
All Wikimedia projects run on MediaWiki version .
As MediaWiki is more flexible , therefore many websites use MediaWiki rather than other types of wiki software .
Except Wikimedia , Wikia is also another company that uses MediaWiki greatly for people to contribute information .
There are also some websites that uses MediaWiki as a content management system .
In MediaWiki , a system administrator can choose to install extension provided on the main MediaWiki website .
Some are from the MediaWiki developers , while others are from programmers from all around the world .
Most extensions can be download from Wikimedia 's Subversion repository .
However , there are some other extensions that other people host themselves .
Some extensions had been added to the main software along the development of MediaWiki .
For example , the Makesysop extension is an extension to promote a user into an administrator or a bureaucrat .
There is a total of 1790 extensions as of March 2 , 2011 .
Additional namespaces can be added using the settings file from the installation of MediaWiki .
As MediaWiki is a complex software , there would always be bugs in the software , especially for new extensions .
Therefore , Wikimedia has create a bugzilla website for people who meet a bug to tell the developers of MediaWiki .
Some extensions of MediaWiki use the Wikimedia Bugzilla , while some just use the talk page of the extension page .
During the development of MediaWiki , different skins have came into the main software .
For example , Wikipedia used to be using Nostalgia .
But it changed to Monobook before the new Vector skin came up in 1.16 .
A survey done by Wikimedia showed that more people prefer the Vector skin more .
A first language -LRB- also mother tongue , native language , arterial language , or L1 -RRB- is the language a person first learns .
A person 's first language helps them understand words and concepts in the style of that first language .
`` First language '' sometimes does not mean this , however .
Sometimes first language means the language a person speaks best -LRB- his second language is language he speaks less well than his first language , etc -RRB- .
Sometimes first language , second language and third language show how well one speaks a language , so a person can have more than one first language or second language .
A mile is a unit of length .
There are many different kinds of mile .
In the US and the UK the word mile usually means the statute mile .
The nautical mile is used for sea or air travel .
The nautical mile was originally defined as one minute of arc along a line of longitude of the Earth .
There are 60 minutes of arc in one degree or arc -LRB- 60 ' = 1 Â -RRB- .
So there were 10,800 nautical miles from the North Pole to the South Pole .
Now the nautical mile is defined as 1,852 metres .
The mile was first used by the Romans .
It comes from the Latin phrase mille passus -LRB- plural : milia passuum -RRB- .
This means `` one thousand paces '' .
A pace is the distance each foot moves when taking one step .
Different miles have been used throughout history in various parts of the world .
In Norway and Sweden , for example , a mil is a unit of length which is equal to 10 kilometres .
Margarine is an artificial butter .
It can be made from vegetable oil , or animal fat .
It may also contain skimmed milk , salt and emulsifiers .
Margarine is used in many baked products .
It contains less fat than butter , so is often chosen instead of it .
There are also `` low fat '' margarines , which contain even less fat .
However , many types of margarine contain trans fats , which are unhealthy and can cause heart disease .
Other vegetables fats , like olive oil , are a better choice for cooking .
The Milky Way is our home galaxy .
It contains over 200 billion stars , including our Earth and Sun .
The Milky Way has a diameter of 100,000 light years .
The discovery of the Milky Way goes back to the Ancient Greek philosopher Democritus .
The Milky Way galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy .
This galaxy belongs to a local group of three large galaxies and 30 smaller galaxies .
Milky Way is the second biggest galaxy in the group behind the Andromeda Galaxy .
Milky Way 's closest neighbor is Canis Major Dwarf , which is about 25,000 light years away from the Earth .
The Andromeda Galaxy moves towards the Milky Way Galaxy , and will meet it in about 3 billion years .
Andromeda Galaxy moves with a speed of about 1,800 kilometres per minute .
The stellar disk of the Milky Way Galaxy is approximately 100,000 light-years -LRB- 9 Ã -- 1017 km -RRB- in diameter , and is considered to be , on average , about 1000 light years thick .
It is estimated to contain at least 200 billion stars and possibly up to 400 billion stars .
The figure depends on the number of very low-mass , or dwarf stars , which are hard to detect , especially more than 300 light years from our sun .
Therefore , present estimates of the total number are uncertain .
This can be compared to the one trillion -LRB- 1012 -RRB- stars of the neighbouring Andromeda Galaxy .
The stellar disc does not have a sharp edge , a radius beyond which there are no stars .
Rather , the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the center of the Galaxy .
Beyond a radius of roughly 40000 light years , the number of stars drops much faster with radius , for reasons that are not understood .
Extending beyond the stellar disk is a much thicker disk of gas .
Recent observations indicate that the gaseous disk of the Milky Way has a thickness of around 12000 light years -- twice the previously accepted value .
As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way , if the Solar System out to the orbit of Pluto were reduced to the size of a US quarter -LRB- approximately one inch in diameter -RRB- the Milky Way would be the size of the continental United States west of the Mississippi .
The Galactic Halo extends outward , but is limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites , the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds , whose perigalacticon is at about 180000 light years .
At this distance or beyond , the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds , and the objects would likely be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way .
The galactic disc , which bulges outward at the galactic center , has a diameter of 70 â `` 100,000 light years .
The exact distance from the Sun to the galactic center is debated .
The latest estimates give distances to the Galactic center of 25 -- 28,000 light years .
Movement of material around the galactic center shows that it has a compact object of very large mass. .
The intense radio source named Sagittarius A \* , thought to mark the center of the Milky Way , is now confirmed to be a supermassive black hole .
Most galaxies are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their center .
The nature of the galaxy 's bar is also actively debated , with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning from 3,300 â `` 16,000 light years -LRB- short or a long bar -RRB- and 10 â `` 50 degrees .
Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy , it would be the brightest feature of our own galaxy .
Metaphor is a figure of speech .
It uses words , not literally , but figuratively .
It takes a word from its original context , and uses it in another .
`` I beat him with a stick '' = literal meaning of ` beat ' .
`` I beat him in an argument '' = metaphorical meaning of ` beat ' .
We use metaphors to make indirect comparisons , but without using ` like ' or ` as ' -- because that would be a simile .
A simile is a direct comparison : `` Jane is like a child '' .
Most metaphors are concepts : see conceptual metaphor .
A metaphor very often uses the verb ` to be ' : `` love is war '' , for example , not `` love is like war '' -LRB- that is a simile -RRB- .
Poetry includes much metaphor , usually more than prose .
Idioms use metaphors , or are metaphors : for example , the English phrase to kick the bucket means to die .
Spam is an example that any email user knows about â `` this word was originally a metaphor , from ` Spam ' , a type of canned meat .
Servers putting unwanted email into somebody 's inbox was similar to waiters putting unwanted Spam into food .
This was originally suggested by a Monty Python skit -LRB- funny scene -RRB- .
When we use a metaphor very often and we forget the old meaning , or forget that the two meanings are connected , this is a ` dead metaphor ' .
Originally metaphor was a Greek word for ` transfer ' .
It came from meta -LRB- ` change ' -RRB- and pherein -LRB- ` carry ' -RRB- .
So the word metaphor in English was a metaphor , too .
Today in Greek , metaphor is a trolley -LRB- a thing that is pushed for carrying shopping or bags -RRB- .
A simple metaphor has a single link between the subject and the metaphoric vehicle .
The vehicle thus has a single meaning which is transferred directly to the subject .
In the simple metaphor , the cognitive effort to understand what the author or speaker intends is relatively low , and hence it may easily be used with a wider and less sophisticated audience .
The simple metaphor may be contrasted against metaphors which have multiple elements and meanings , for example in the compound metaphor or complex metaphor .
A simple metaphor is also known as a tight metaphor .
A complex metaphor happens where a simple metaphor is based on a secondary metaphoric element .
For example using a metaphor of ` light ' for ` understanding ' may be complexified by saying ` throwing light ' rather than ` shining light ' .
` Throwing ' is an extra metaphor for how light arrives .
A compound metaphor is one where there are multiple parts in the metaphor that are used to snag the listener .
These parts may be enhancement words such as adverbs , adjectives , etc.
Each part in the compound metaphor may be used to signify an additional item of meaning .
Compound metaphors are like a multiple punch , hitting the listener repeatedly with metaphoric elements .
Where the complex metaphor uses stacked layers to enhance the metaphor , the compound metaphor uses sequential words .
The compound metaphor is also known as a loose metaphor .
A live metaphor is one which a reader notices .
A dead metaphor is one no-one notices because it has become so common in the language .
Two people walk off a tennis court .
Someone asks the loser : `` What happened ? '' .
Metabolism is the system of chemical activities by which a living thing gets power -LRB- energy -RRB- from other things such as food .
This depends , for example , on how often someone eats .
If they are hungry their metabolism slows down dramatically .
Metabolism uses energy to fuel all organs involved in digestion and respiration and so on .
The new amount of energy used to carry out these life processes is called the BMR-rate or `` basal metabolic rate '' .
The bigger someone is , the lower their metabolism rate would become .
This is due to a lower volume to surface area ratio .
Mass can also mean a Christian religious ritual , see Mass -LRB- liturgy -RRB- .
Such celebrations often have music in them .
It can also refer to the music sung or played during such a celebration , see Mass -LRB- music -RRB- .
Mass is the amount of matter in a body .
An object has the same mass where ever it is .
You can think of mass as the amount of stuff that is in an object , in a way that does not depend on how much space it takes up .
The SI unit of mass is the kilogram , written as kg .
There are also many other units of weight -LRB- mass with gravity pulling on it -RRB- : tonnes -LRB- t -RRB- , pounds -LRB- lb . -RRB-
, and ounces -LRB- oz . -RRB- .
Other units of mass used in science and engineering include slugs , atomic mass units , Planck masses , Solar masses , and eV\/c2 .
The last unit is based on the electron volt -LRB- eV -RRB- , which is usually used as a unit of energy .
Weighing scales measure weight , and balances measure mass.
Matter can not be created nor can it be destroyed , only changed .
However , mass can be changed into energy .
Physicists do not know what gives an object mass. .
The Standard Model of particle physics thinks that mass is caused by the Higgs field .
Physicists are trying to find the Higgs field now using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN .
In physics , Special Relativity shows that the mass of an object becomes bigger when the object moves very fast .
As the speed gets close to the speed of light the mass becomes very big .
where m - mass of body , v - speed of body , c - speed of light .
Some things that do not have mass on their own act like they have mass because of their movement .
This is true for light - a light photon has no mass , but its energy can act as mass when it hits something .
Technically , light does not have mass , but it does have momentum .
From its momentum you can figure out what mass would produce the same momentum at the speed of light , but this is an `` as if '' kind of mass , not real mass.
Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System .
It is the closest planet to the sun .
It makes one trip around the Sun once every 87.969 days .
Mercury is bright when it is able to be seen from Earth , ranging from â ' 2.0 to 5.5 in apparent magnitude , but is not easily seen as it is usually too close to the Sun .
Since Mercury is normally lost in the glare of the Sun , unless there is a solar eclipse , Mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening twilight .
Compared to what is known about the other planets in the Solar System , little is known about Mercury ; telescopes on the Earth show only a small , bright crescent .
The first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was Mariner 10 , which mapped only about 45 % of the planetâ s surface from 1974 to 1975 .
The second is the MESSENGER spacecraft , which mapped another 30 % during its trip to Mercury on January 14 , 2008 .
MESSENGER made one more pass by Mercury in 2009 , and is now orbiting the planet to complete the mapping .
Mercury looks a lot like our Moon : it has many craters with areas of smooth plains , no moons around it and no atmosphere .
Mercury does have what is known as an exosphere .
However , unlike the moon , it has a large iron core , which gives off a magnetic field about 1 % as strong as that of the Earth .
It is a very dense planet due to the large size of its core .
Surface temperatures can be anywhere from about 90 to -LRB- â ' 183 Â C to 427 Â C , â ' 297 Â F to 801 Â F -RRB- , with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest .
Known sightings of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC .
Before the 4th century BC , Greek astronomers thought that Mercury was two different objects : one able to be seen only at sunrise , which they called Apollo ; the other that was only able to be seen at sunset , which they called Hermes .
The English name for the planet is from the Romans , who named it after the Roman god Mercury , which they thought to be the same as the Greek god Hermes .
The symbol for Mercury is based on Hermes ' staff .
Mercury is one of four inner planets in the Solar System , and has a rocky body like the Earth .
It is the smallest planet in the Solar System , with a radius of 2,439.7 km .
Mercury is even smaller , though it has a greater mass , than the largest moons in our Solar System .
Mercury is made of about 70 % metallic and 30 % silicate material .
Mercury 's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g\/cm Â , only a little bit less than Earthâ s.
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System .
Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it is a red planet , which signifies the color of blood .
Mars has two very small moons , called Phobos and Deimos .
The planet Mars is made of rock .
The ground there is red because of iron oxide -LRB- rust -RRB- in the rocks and dust .
The planet has a small carbon dioxide atmosphere .
The temperatures on Mars are colder than on Earth , because it is farther away from the Sun .
There is some ice at the north and south poles of Mars , and also frozen carbon dioxide .
Mars does not have any water on the surface now , except at the poles , but most scientists think it used to have water .
The average thickness of the planet 's crust is about 50 km -LRB- 31 mi -RRB- , with a maximum thickness of 125 km -LRB- 78 mi -RRB- .
Earth 's crust , on average 40 km -LRB- 25 mi -RRB- , is three times smaller than Marsâ crust based on the sizes of the two planets if they are made equal .
Mars has been known since old times .
The Greeks named this planet Ares , after their god of war .
The Romans named the planet Mars .
The Roman God of War was called Mars .
Some of the first attempts at making a map of Mars were done by Giovanni Schiaparelli .
What he saw through his telescope confused him .
He saw what he called canali , which he thought were ditches dug for water to pass through .
Because of this , people thought that there were other animals and life on Mars , possibly even aliens .
Today , we know there can not be any such aliens .
This is because the crafts sent to Mars have found no trace of alien life , and what could have been bacteria were formed at temperatures too high for life to exist .
What Giovanni actually saw were the scratches on his telescope lense .
This may sound completely absurd but this is really what happened ; he spent his whole life studying the marks on his telescope thinking they were alien made water streams .
Because Mars is the one of the closest planets to Earth in the Solar System , some people have wondered if there is any kind of life on Mars .
Recently , scientists found an old meteorite that had landed near the Earth 's South Pole and decided it had come from Mars .
In the meteorite they found some very tiny little shapes in the rock which they think might be fossils made by living things .
However , they were not sure if it was life or just the natural patterns of the rock .
If it were the fossils of a living thing , it was probably some simple plant , and one hundred of them could fit across the width of a single hair .
It is also possible that there are also pieces of the earth on Mars .
If a giant meteorite hit the Earth , the force would be strong enough to send pieces of the earth up to space .
If a piece of earth left the atmosphere , it would take along with it lots of cells and bacteria , which are living things .
Mars rotates in 24 hours , and 37 minutes .
It rotates on a tilt , just like the Earth does , so it has four different seasons .
However , these seasons are quite different from the seasons on Earth .
Winter , spring , fall , and summer would all be freezing cold because it is always freezing on Mars .
Mars is too far away from the sun to get enough energy from the sun 's light , and the atmosphere is much too thin to keep the warmth inside .
The usual temperature on Mars is usually about 81 degrees below zero , and in the summer , the temperature goes up about 32 degrees .
Because it is so cold on Mars , carbon dioxide freezes in the winter and makes a lot of dry ice .
On earth , there is much liquid water , but people have not found any liquid water on Mars .
Scientists think that all of the water on Mars is frozen .
The summer in Mars is warm enough to get rid of the dry ice , but it is not warm enough to melt the ice that is made of water .
Scientists think that the rest of the water on Mars is permanently frozen in the ground -LRB- permanently frozen ice is called permafrost , so there 's a lot of permafrost in Mars ! -RRB- .
However , Opportunity rover has found a rock formation on Mars which suggests that the rocks might have been in salt water once .
The Spirit rover also found traces of a mineral called jarosite , which is made in liquid water .
So there is some evidence that liquid water did , once , exist on Mars -LRB- this means that Mars must have been much warmer long ago -RRB- .
Even though Mars is really cold , it 's actually closer to the Earth 's temperature than any other planet in the Solar System .
This is the reason lots of people think of sending humans to Mars one day , and dream of building an artifice ecosystem that will protect people .
Mars has a very thin atmosphere with barely any oxygen -LRB- it is mostly carbon dioxide -RRB- .
Because there is an atmosphere , however thin it is , the sky does change colors when the sun rises and sets .
The dust in the Martian atmosphere make the Martian sunsets have a rather blue color .
Mars 's atmosphere , of course , is too thin to protect Mars from meteors well , which is why the bottom half of Mars has so many craters .
Some craters hit Mars with so much force a few pieces of Mars went flying into space - even into Earth !
People have actually found rocks on Earth that have chemicals in them - chemicals that are like the ones in Martian rocks .
These rocks also look like they fell really quickly through the atmosphere , so it is reasonable to think they came from Mars .
Mars is home to the highest known mountain in the Solar System , Olympus Mons .
Olympus Mons is about 17 miles -LRB- or 27 kilometers -RRB- high .
This is more than three times the height of Earth 's tallest mountain , Mount Everest .
Some famous stories were written about this idea .
The writers used the name `` Martians '' for intelligent beings from Mars .
In 1898 H. G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds , a famous novel about Martians attacking the Earth .
In 1938 , Orson Welles broadcast a radio version of this story in the United States , and many people thought it was really happening and were very afraid .
Beginning in 1912 , Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote several novels about adventures on Mars .
As of February 2011 , scientists have not found life on Mars , either living now or extinct .
Several space probes without people have gone to Mars to study it .
Some have orbited -LRB- gone around -RRB- the planet , and some have landed on it .
There are pictures of the surface of Mars that were sent back to Earth by some of these probes .
Some people are interested in sending astronauts to visit Mars .
This would be difficult .
The astronauts would be in space for many years , and it could be very dangerous because of radiation from the sun .
The Macintosh Operating System -LRB- Mac OS -RRB- is a program that allows a Macintosh computer to operate and be used by humans .
Mac OS was first made by Apple Inc. in 1984 .
In those days Mac OS was called Macintosh System Software â `` which was shortened to System or SSW -LRB- System Software -RRB- .
The term `` Mac OS '' first appeared in the splash screen for System 7.5.1 , but was not adopted as the new name until the release of Mac OS 7.6 .
The latest version of Mac OS is Mac OS X 10.6.6 .
A metre -LRB- US spelling , meter -RRB- is the basic unit of length in the SI measurement system .
The abbreviation for the metre is m. The first meaning -LRB- in the French Revolution -RRB- , it was 1\/10 ,000,000 th -LRB- one ten-millionth -RRB- of the distance between the Earth 's equator and the North Pole along the Paris meridian .
The metre is now officially defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1\/299 ,792,458 th of a second .
In the imperial system of measurement , one metre is equal to about 39.37 inches , 3.28 feet , or about 1.09 yards .
A magnifying glass is a lens through which you can look to make things appear bigger , so you can see them better .
The magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex-shaped glass or plastic .
It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object .
The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle .
A telescope is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses .
A pair of binoculars is like a telescope for each eye .
Spectacles or eyeglasses also use lenses to correct a person 's vision .
A molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist .
If a molecule were split into smaller pieces , it would be a different substance .
Molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape or form .
Not all combinations of atoms are usually possible ; atoms like certain shapes , but not others .
For example , oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms , carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms , and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms .
In gases like air , the molecules are just flying around .
In liquids like water , the molecules are stuck together but they can still move .
In solids like sugar , the molecules can only vibrate .
With a molecular formula , you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule .
For example , the molecular formula of sugar is C6H12O6 .
That means that one molecule of sugar is made up of six carbon atoms , twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms .
For a molecule to exist , atoms have to stick together .
This happens when two atoms share electrons .
Instead of circling just one atom , the electron now circles around two .
This is called bonding .
The shared electrons are called ` bonds ' .
Sometimes , more than one electron is shared .
The more electrons are shared , the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together .
Bonds can also be broken apart .
Since most bonds require energy to form , they also give off energy when they are broken .
But before most bonds break , the molecule has to be heated .
Then the atoms start to move , and when they move too much , the bond breaks .
Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels .
For example , a candle will just sit there and nothing happens .
But when you use a match to light it , it will burn for a long time .
The match brings the energy to break the first bonds , which release enough energy to break the bonds below them , until the candle has burned down .
Moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy .
It studies how people think about moral issues , problems , and questions .
Psychologists who have studied it include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel .
Kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older , but Turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older .
Moral philosophy , or ethics , is a major branch of philosophy .
It is the study of value or quality .
It covers the analysis and use of concepts such as right , wrong , good , evil , and responsibility .
A mosque is a place where Muslims worship .
The word mosque comes from the Arabic word masjid .
A mosque may be small , and privately owned .
A larger , ` collective ' , mosque is called a masjid jÄ mi .
Larger mosques offer more services to their community .
For many Muslim people , a mosque is more than a place of worship .
Muslims worship , study and discuss Islam , and do many other things in a mosque and its compounds .
In the United Kingdom , many mosques are used as community centres .
They are also used to teach about Islam .
Religious festivals and gatherings are held in mosques .
Weddings are one example .
Mosques have rules to control what people do inside .
One of these rules is that it is considered rude to disturb another person who is worshipping .
Many mosques are known for their Islamic architecture .
The earliest mosques , opened in 7th century were open-air spaces .
They are the Quba Mosque and Masjid al-Nabawi .
Later mosques were buildings that were specially designed .
Nowadays , mosques can be found on every continent , except Antarctica .
Many mosques are famous works of architecture .
They are often built in a style that has stayed the same for many centuries .
Many mosques have prayer halls , domes , and minarets .
They may also have a courtyard .
Mosques were first built on the Arabian Peninsula .
The Muslims who built them used old architectural styles .
They also combined these styles in new ways .
A major influence was the palaces built during the Parthian and Sassanid dynasties of Persia .
The Sarvestan palace from the Sassanid era is a good example of this .
It has an arched entrance and a central dome .
These features already existed in Persia before Islam .
After the Arab invasion of Persia , the new style , with its Sassanid influence , was used for the new Islamic world .
Many forms of mosques have developed in different regions of the Islamic world .
Important mosque types include the early Abbasid mosques , T-type mosques , and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia .
In the 20th century , many countries that grew rich from oil paid for the building of many new mosques .
The rulers of these countries often hired leading architects to design these mosques .
They included non-Muslims .
Many early mosques have a square or rectangular plan .
They also have a prayer hall and an enclosed courtyard .
This is known as Arab-plan .
The first mosques of this type were built during the Umayyad Dynasty .
The flat roof of the prayer hall was supported by columns .
Many rows of columns were needed to support such roofs ; this is called `` hypostyle architecture '' .
One of the most famous hypostyle mosques is the Mezquita de CÃ rdoba in Spain .
It is supported by over 850 columns .
In the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates , the courtyard served to hold the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers .
Often , hypostyle mosques have outer arcades .
They allow the visitors to enjoy the shade .
Arab-plan mosques were built mostly during the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties .
The Arab plan was very simple , which did not allow for much further development .
This caused that style of mosque to fall out of favor .
The Ottomans began building central dome mosques in the fifteenth century .
These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall .
There may also be smaller domes , which are off-center over the prayer hall or the rest of the mosque .
This style was heavily influenced by the Byzantine religious architecture with its use of large central domes .
Iwan mosques are famous for their domed rooms and iwans .
Iwans are spaces with an arched roof .
They have an opening at one end .
One or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall .
The style borrows from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture .
Most mosques with this style are in Iran .
Most mosques have minarets .
Minarets are tall towers .
Usually they are at one of the corners of the mosque .
The top of the minaret is the highest point in the mosque , and usually the highest point in the area around the mosque .
The tallest minaret in the world is in the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca , Morocco .
The first mosques had no minarets .
The most conservative Islamic groups , like Wahhabis , still avoid building minarets .
They see them as simply a fancy decoration and unnecessary .
The first minaret was built in 665 in Basra during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I. Muawiyah encouraged the building of minarets , as they were supposed to be the same as bell towers on Christian churches .
Because of this , mosque architects used the shape of the bell tower for their minarets .
Both the minaret and the bell tower serve the same purpose â '' to call the faithful to prayer .
Before the five required daily prayers , a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret .
In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority , mosques are stopped from loudly playing the call to prayer .
The main problem is the use of electronic amplification of the call , which is now widely used by mosques .
The domes were often placed directly above the main prayer hall .
They represent the vaults of heaven and the sky .
At first , these domes were small .
They only took up a small part of the roof near the mihrab .
Later , they took the whole roof above the prayer hall .
Domes normally have the shape of a hemisphere .
The Mughals in India popularized onion-shaped domes in South Asia and Persia .
Some mosques have several domes , as well as the main large dome .
The other domes are often smaller .
Domes would help the imam be heard , as the sound waves would bounce in and then out of the dome making the voice louder .
All mosques have a prayer hall , which is also called musalla .
Normally , there is no furniture in it except for prayer mats or rugs .
These are necessary , as Islamic prayer is usually done kneeling .
Some mosques have Arabic calligraphy and Qur ` anic verses on the walls to help worshipers focus on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book , the Qur ` an , as well as for decoration .
The qiblah wall is usually at the other side of the entrance to the prayer hall .
This wall is specially decorated .
In a properly sited mosque , it will be set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca .
People pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall .
They arrange themselves so they face Mecca .
In the qiblah wall , usually at its center , is the mihrab , a niche or depression showing the direction of Mecca .
The mihrab serves as the place where the imam leads the five daily prayers .
All people must wash themselves before they pray .
Mosques often have fountains or other facilities for washing in their entrances or courtyards , so that people can perform the washing ritual before prayer .
At very small mosques , worshipers may use restrooms for their ritual washing .
In traditional mosques , there is often a building specially for washing .
This is often in the center of the courtyard .
In the prayer halls , people must not wear shoes for much the same reason .
Modern mosques should appeal to the community they serve .
For this reason , other facilities may also be available at the mosque , like health clinics , libraries and gymnasia .
There may be decorative tiles , plaster or colored mosaics on the walls .
Adult Muslims are expected to pray five times a day .
Most mosques have formal prayers for each of these times .
If performing the prayer is difficult , for example for ill people , then exceptions are made .
Mosques also hold a special prayer service , called jumuah .
This is done once a week .
It is a form of Sabbath and replaces the Friday prayers at the mosque .
Daily prayers can be done anywhere .
However , Muslims are expected to do their Friday prayer at the mosque .
When a Muslim dies , a funeral prayer is normally held .
It is held outdoors in a courtyard or square close to the mosque .
The prayers have all the worshippers present , including the imam , taking part .
During eclipses , mosques will host special prayers called eclipse prayers .
There are two large holidays -LRB- Eids -RRB- in the Islamic calendar .
During these days , there are special prayers at mosques in the morning .
Larger mosques will normally hold them for their own communities as well as the people from smaller local mosques .
Mosques , especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority , will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards or town squares .
There are many events in Ramadan , Islam 's holiest month .
During Ramadan , Mulims must fast during the day .
Mosques organise iftar dinners after sunset .
These are done after the fourth required prayer of the day .
Part of the food is given by members of the community , which creates nightly potluck dinners .
The community contribution to these dinners is required .
For this reason , mosques with smaller communities may not be able to hold the iftar dinners daily .
Some mosques will also hold meals in the morning before dawn .
Mosques will often invite poorer members of the community to these meals .
Islam sees giving charity during Ramadan as good acts .
Larger mosques sometimes offer special , optional prayers .
They are done after the last required prayer of the day .
During each night of prayers , one member of the community who has memorized the entire Qurâ an will recite a part of the book .
It can last for up to two hours .
Sometimes , several such people -LRB- not necessarily of the local community -RRB- take turns to do this .
During the last ten days of Ramadan , larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe Laylat al-Qadr .
It is the night Muslims believe that the Islamic prophet Muhammad first received Qur ` anic revelations .
On that night , between sunset and sunrise , mosques employ speakers to teach the worshipers about Islam .
Mosques or the community usually provide meals at times through the night .
During the late twentieth century , more and more mosques have been used for political purposes .
Modern-day mosques in the Western world want to educate good citizens .
The details differ greatly from mosque to mosque and from country to country .
Countries with small Muslim populations use mosques as a way to support civic participation .
They are more likely to do this than Muslim-majority countries of the Greater Middle East .
American mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives .
In the United States , Muslims are often immigrants , or the children of immigrants .
Mosques want to interest these people for politics .
They also want to keep them informed about issues that concern the Muslim community .
People who attend the services at the mosque regularly are more likely to take part in protests , to sign petitions , and to involve themselves in political matters .
A link between political views and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world .
After the al-Askari Mosque bombing in February 2006 , imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and Friday prayers to call for calm and peace during the widespread violence .
Beginning in the late twentieth century and continuing into the early twenty-first century , a small number of mosques have also become a base for extremist imams to support terrorism and extreme Islamic ideals .
Finsbury Park Mosque in London is a mosque that has been used in this manner .
Like other places of worship , mosques can be at the center of social conflicts .
Babri Mosque was the center of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished .
Before a solution could be found , the mosque was destroyed by about 200,000 Hindus .
It took place on 6 December 1992 .
The mosque was built by Babur to mark the birth place of Ram .
It was believed to be on a site of an earlier Hindu temple .
The conflict over the mosque was directly linked to rioting in Bombay -LRB- present-day Mumbai -RRB- as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people .
In February 2006 , a bombing seriously damaged Iraq 's al-Askari Mosque .
This increased the existing tensions .
The conflict between two Muslim groups in Iraq had already led to other bombings .
However mosque bombings are not limited to Iraq .
In June 2005 , a suicide bomber killed at least 19 people at an Afghan mosque .
In April 2006 , there were two explosions at India 's Jama Masjid .
After the September 11 attacks , several American mosques were targets of attacks .
These ranged from simple vandalism to arson .
The Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City , California .
There were similar attacks in the United Kingdom after the 7 July 2005 London bombings .
Outside the Western world , in June 2001 , the Hassan Bek Mosque was the target of attacks .
The attacks involved hundreds of Israelis angry at Arabs for a previous attack .
Saudi involvement in building mosques around the world only goes back to the 1960s .
In the 1980s , the Saudi Arabian government began to pay for the building of mosques in countries around the world .
An estimated US$ 45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government for mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries .
Ain al-Yaqeen , a Saudi newspaper , reported in 2002 that Saudi money may have helped to build as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers .
Saudi citizens have also given a lot of money to mosques in the Islamic world , especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed .
Following the fall of the Soviet Union , in 1992 , mosques in Afghanistan received money from Saudi citizens .
The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City , California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome are two of Saudi Arabia 's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud gave US$ 8 million and US$ 50 million to the two mosques , respectively .
In a mosque , people should keep focused on worshiping Allah .
For this reason , there are a number of rules about the correct behavior in a mosque .
Some of these rules are the same all over the world , such as no shoes should be worn in the prayer hall .
Other rules are different from mosque to mosque .
It is generally seen as good to have someone who leads the prayers , though this is not strictly necessary .
The person who usually leads the prayers is called imam .
He must be a free and honest man .
He should also be an authority when it comes to answering questions on religion .
In mosques that were built or that are kept up by the government , the imam is selected by the ruler .
In private mosques , the community selects the imam , through majority voting .
Only men may lead prayers for men .
Women are allowed to lead prayers for congregations where there are only women .
In addition to washing , there are other rules that also apply to those who enter the mosque , even if they do not wish to pray there .
It is forbidden to wear shoes in the carpeted area of the prayer hall .
Some mosques also do not allow wearing shoes in other parts , even though these may not be devoted to praying .
Islam requires that its believers wear clothes that show modesty .
As a result , both men and women must follow this rule when they attend a mosque -LRB- though mosques may not always enforce the rules -RRB- .
Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not show the shape of the body .
Similarly , women who come to the mosque are expected to wear loose clothing , shirts , pants that cover to the wrists and ankles and cover their heads such as with a hijab .
Many Muslims , regardless of their ethnic background , wear Middle eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques .
Mosques are places of worship .
For this reason , those inside the mosque should be respectful to those who are praying .
Loud talking or discussion of topics that could be disrespectful , is forbidden in areas where people are praying .
It is also considered as rude to walk in front of Muslims in prayer or otherwise disturb them .
Islamic law requires men and women to be separated in the prayer hall .
Ideally , women should pray behind men .
Muhammad said , women should pray at home , not at the mosque .
Muhammad thought women should not be forbidden in mosques .
The second caliph Umar at one time stopped women from attending mosques , especially at night , because he feared they may be teased by males , so he made them to pray at home .
Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women ; for example , the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women .
Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room .
Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms , as the divisions were built into them centuries ago .
In nearly two-thirds of American mosques , women pray behind partitions or in separate areas , not in the main prayer hall ; some mosques do not admit women at all .
Although there are sections only for women and children , the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated .
A few scholars of Islamic law believe that non-Muslims may be allowed into mosques , as long as they do not sleep or eat there .
Followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence disagree .
They say that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques at all .
Different countries have different opinions on the question .
Nearly all the mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow non-Muslims .
The Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims .
In modern-day Saudi Arabia , the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims .
Likewise , the Masjid al-Nabawi and the city of Medina that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam .
For mosques in other areas , it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a proper reason .
In modern Turkey non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque , but must obey the rules of decorum .
Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers ; visitors must wear long trousers and take off their shoes ; women must cover their heads ; no photos ; no loud talk is allowed .
No references to other religions are allowed -LRB- no crosses on necklaces , no cross gestures etc.
However , there are also many other places in the west as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques .
Most mosques in the United States , for example , report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month .
Many Mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community and to encourage conversions to Islam .
Dogs are usually banned from entering mosques , but on 24 September 2008 , the Muslim Law Council UK made special ruling , called a fatwa , which granted a blind Muslim permission to take his guide dog into the mosque .
It is common for a smaller mosque to serve as a hostel for Muslims on haj -LRB- pilgrimage to Mecca -RRB- .
Sometimes mosques are used for refugees , or as temporary homes for homeless people .
Obligations to neighbors in Islam are very strict , and specific .
In the Qur ` an Mohammed said that a person who helps others in the hour of need , and who helps the oppressed ; that person God will help on the Day of Travail -LRB- agony -RRB- .
There are other commands , such as helping the poor and being nice to people .
An important part of being Muslim , or just being part of the mosque , is taking care of people who need help .
A mosque is a social , as well as a religious , group .
A madrassa is a little different from a mosque .
A madrassa focuses on teaching Islam , usually to children and young people .
When Spain was under Muslim control , some of the most beautiful buildings were mosques .
After 1492 , Spain was under Christian control .
However , the Christians did not tear down the mosques .
They simply put a crucifix in them to make them into churches .
These mosques influenced the Renaissance architecture -LRB- way of building -RRB- in Europe .
Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals which form the class Mammalia .
They have these features :
Most mammals -LRB- but not all -RRB- bear live young .
All mammals feed their young on milk , which is made by glands in the skin or the mammary glands .
All mammals protect and look after their young , though details differ greatly .
Mammals are warm-blooded ; they regulate their body temperature .
The heat they need to live is made chemically inside their body .
With this goes a higher rate of metabolism , and heat-retaining fur .
One diagnostic feature is the lower jaw which , unlike earlier forms , is composed of a single bone , the dentary .
Another diagnostic feature is the neocortex of the brain , which no other vertebrate has .
Almost all mammals give birth to live young .
There are only two mammals that lay eggs , called Monotremes , the Duck-billed Platypus Ornithorhynchus , and the Spiny Anteater Echidna , with four species .
All are confined to Australia and New Guinea , and are the sole survivors of an earlier group of mammals .
However , like other mammals , they feed milk to their young , and protect and look after them .
Other mammals are divided into the Marsupials and the Eutheria , the placental mammals .
Marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in , like the kangaroo .
All other mammals are Eutherian .
Mammals are found on land and in water , and also in the air , where they compete with lots of other animals .
Their ability to move from place to place and adapt has made them a most efficient group .
Many mammals live in cold places .
These mammals have thick hair or blubber to keep them warm .
Others may live in rainforests .
Some live in deserts , and still others are in rivers , lakes , and seas all around the world .
Sea-going mammals , the Cetacea and the pinnipeds , are very successful and significant predators .
This includes the whales , seals , walrus , dolphins and others .
In the air , the bats -LRB- Chiroptera -RRB- are the mammalian order with the most species .
They ` own ' the nighttime , since birds are largely diurnal -LRB- daytime -RRB- animals .
On land the rodents -LRB- rats , mice -RRB- are hugely successful , more common in numbers than any other mammals .
Large mammals on land have been hunted to extinction in many parts of the world .
The ones which remain are now being better protected .
Last , but certainly not least , are the primates .
Their natural habitat , with few exceptions are the forests .
Most live in the trees , with hands that grasp , good color vision , and intelligence .
In the Pliocene period some moved out onto the savannahs as grassland began to replace forests .
This sort of classification is not traditional , but it does reflect our knowledge of palaeontology and evolution .
A somewhat standardized classification system has been adopted by most current mammalogy classroom textbooks .
It is based on living animals .
The following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is from Vaughan et al . 2000 .
For the book in the Bible , see Numbers -LRB- Bible -RRB- .
A number is a concept from mathematics , used to count or measure .
Depending on the field of mathematics , where numbers are used , there are different definitions :
Numbers are also used for other things besides counting .
Numbers are used when things are measured .
Numbers are used to study how the world works .
Mathematics is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things .
The study of the rules of the natural world is called science .
The work that uses numbers to make things is called engineering
There are different ways of giving symbols to numbers .
These methods are called number systems .
The most common number system that people use is the base ten number system .
The base ten number system is also called the decimal number system .
The base ten number system is common because people have ten fingers and ten toes .
There are 10 different symbols used in the base ten number system .
These ten symbols are called digits .
A symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits .
The position of the digits shows how big the number is .
For example , the number 23 in the decimal number system really means 2 times 10 plus 3 , and 101 means 1 times a hundred -LRB- = 100 -RRB- plus 0 times 10 -LRB- = 0 -RRB- plus 1 times 1 -LRB- = 1 -RRB- .
Another number system is more common for machines .
The machine number system is called the binary number system .
The binary number system is also called the base two number system .
There are two different symbols -LRB- 0,1 -RRB- used in the base two number system .
These two symbols are called bits .
A symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols .
The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is .
For example , the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0 , and 101 means 1 times four -LRB- = 4 -RRB- plus 0 times two -LRB- = 0 -RRB- plus 1 times 1 -LRB- = 1 -RRB- .
The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2 .
The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5 .
English has special names for some of the numbers in the decimal number system that are ` powers of ten ' .
All of these power of ten numbers in the decimal number system use just the symbol 1 and the symbol zero .
For example , ten tens is the same as ten times ten , or one hundred .
In symbols , this is `` 10 Ã -- 10 = 100 '' .
Also , ten hundreds is the same as ten times one hundred , or one thousand .
In symbols , this is `` 10 Ã -- 100 = 10 Ã -- 10 Ã -- 10 = 1000 '' .
Some other power of ten numbers also have special names :
When dealing with larger numbers than this , there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English .
Under the ` long scale ' a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number .
It is also called the ` British Standard ' .
This scale used to be common in Britain but is not often used in English speaking countries today .
It is still used in some other European nations .
Another scale is the ` short scale ' under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number .
This scale is a lot more common in most English speaking nations today .
Natural numbers are the numbers which we normally use for counting , 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 etc. .
Some people say that 0 is a natural number , too .
Another name for these numbers is positive numbers .
These numbers are sometimes written as +1 to show that they are different from the negative numbers .
But not all positive numbers are natural -LRB- for example is positive , but not natural -RRB- .
Natural number has two forms .
Some people call it counting numbers whereas some people call it whole numbers .
If you are confused , just remember that the whole number can be including 0 but the counting number does not include 0 .
The natural number can be named as whole number or counting number .
Negative numbers are numbers less than zero .
One way to think of negative numbers is using a number line .
We call one point on this line zero .
Then we will label -LRB- write the name of -RRB- every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is , for example the point one is one centimeter to the right , the point two is two centimeters to the right .
Now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point .
We can not call this point one , as there is already a point called one .
We therefore call this point minus 1 -LRB- -1 -RRB- -LRB- as it is one centimeter away , but in the opposite direction -RRB- .
A drawing of a number line is below .
If people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals .
For example 5 + -LRB- -3 -RRB- is the same as 5 - 3 , and equals 2 .
If they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals .
For example 5 - -LRB- -3 -RRB- is the same as 5 + 3 , and equals 8 .
If they multiply two negative numbers together they get a positive number .
For example -5 times -3 is 15 .
If they multiply a negative number by a positive number , or multiply a positive number by a negative number , they get a negative result .
For example 5 times -3 is -15 .
Integers are whole numbers .
This is all the natural numbers , all their opposites , and the number zero .
Decimal numbers and fractions are not integers .
Rational numbers are numbers which can be written as fractions .
This means that they can be written as a divided by b , where the numbers a and b are integers , and b is not equal to 0 .
Some rational numbers , such as 1\/10 , need a finite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form .
The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 0.1 .
Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational .
Some rational numbers , such as 1\/11 , need an infinite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form .
There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point .
The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as 0.0909090909 ...
A percentage is not totally a rational number but it has relationship with fraction and decimal .
Sometimes , ratio considered as a rational number .
Irrational numbers are numbers which can not be written as a fraction , but do not have imaginary parts .
Irrational numbers often occur in geometry .
For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter , the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two .
This is an irrational number .
In decimal for it is written as 1.414213 ... Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number .
One well known irrational number is pi .
This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter .
This number is the same for every circle .
The number pi is approximately 3.1415926359 ... .
An irrational number can not be fully written down in decimal form .
It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point .
These digits would also not repeat .
This is all numbers but for imaginary numbers .
Imaginary numbers are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number i. This number is the square root of minus one -LRB- -1 -RRB- .
There is no number in the real numbers which when squared makes the number -1 .
Therefore mathematicians invented a number .
They called this number i , or the imaginary unit .
Imaginary numbers were called imaginary because when they were first found many mathematicians did not think they existed .
The person who discovered imaginary numbers was Gerolamo Cardano in the 1500s .
The first to use the word imaginary number was RenÃ Descartes .
The first people to use these numbers were Leonard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss .
Both lived in the 18th century .
Complex numbers are numbers which have two parts ; a real part and an imaginary part .
Every type of number written above is also a complex number .
Complex numbers are a more general form of numbers .
Every equation can be solved using only complex numbers .
The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane .
This is composed of a real number line , and an imaginary number line .
2i _ .
2 +2 i

-2 -2 i -2 i _
To multiply two complex numbers is complicated .
It is easiest to describe in general terms , with two complex numbers a + bi and c + di .
For example -LRB- 4 + 5i -RRB- Ã -- -LRB- 3 + 2i -RRB- = -LRB- 4 Ã -- 3 - 5 Ã -- 2 -RRB- + -LRB- 4 Ã -- 2 + 5 Ã -- 3 -RRB- i = -LRB- 12 - 10 -RRB- + -LRB- 8 + 15 -RRB- i = 2 + 23i .
A real or complex number is called Transcendental number if it can not be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients .
Proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult .
Each transcendental number is also an irrational number .
The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Leonhard Euler .
The first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was Joseph Liouville .
He did this in 1844 .
November is the eleventh month of the year .
It has 30 days .
Its name is from the Latin word novem , which meant `` nine '' .
It was the ninth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman Calendar .
November begins on the same day of the week as March every year and also February except in leap years .
November 's flower is the Chrysanthemum .
Its birthstone is the topaz .
The meaning of the topaz is Fidelity .
A national anthem is a song that the people of a country use to remember and respect their country .
Name is a word -LRB- or a set of words -RRB- given to things and people .
For example , cat is the name of a kind of animal .
`` Ryan '' is a name of a person , usually a male .
`` Julia '' is a common female name .
The word ` name ' can also be used as a verb .
To name something is to give it a name .
In many cultures , there are rules and customs about how to give a person a name .
Some of the rules are defined by laws , and others are defined by traditions -LRB- doing things in the way they have been done for a long time -RRB- .
1 .
Number of parts of a name
In some cultures , a person has a one-part name , such as `` ShiningWater . ''
In other cultures , a person has a two-part name , such as `` John Smith . ''
In some cultures , a person can have any number of name parts .
In the United States , for example , some people have three : first name , middle name , and last name .
Other people have only two : a first and last name .
In Chinese cultures , it is typical for a person to have three-part name , such as `` Cheah Ching San , '' where `` Cheah '' is the surname .
Written in English format a comma is introduced making it `` Ching San , Cheah . ''
2 .
Relations with names of parents and other relatives
In some cultures , people have the same `` family name '' -LRB- or surname -RRB- as their parents .
For example , the father of John Smith may be Mike Smith .
And Mike Smith 's father may be James Smith .
The `` Smith '' part is the same for all the family .
In other cultures , a person has the same name as his or her father , but the name is in a different place .
For example , Shafiq Hanif 's son may be Hanif Kamal .
Hanif is in both the father 's and son 's name .
3 .
Name changes
In some cultures , a name changes when people marry , divorce , go through some religious ceremony , etc. .
For example , in some Spanish-speaking countries , people use two last names : their mother 's father 's name and their father 's name .
If Elena Rodriguez Gomez and Jose Sanchez Soria marry , she may change her name to Elena Rodriguez de Sanchez , and their child could be named Pilar Sanchez Rodriguez , taking the names of both of her grandfathers .
4 .
Name origins
In some cultures , personal names come from history .
In most European countries , some first names are taken from the Bible .
In some cultures , names are taken from a relative .
In other cultures , a name shows what the parents hope their child will be like .
A baby may be given a name Wisdom because parents hope the baby will be a wise girl or boy .
Some cultures avoid giving people a name of an animal .
For example , there is no name like dog , cat , snake , owl , or fish in Japanese people 's first names .
But in some cultures animal names may be good .
5 .
Lengths , pronunciations , spelling , etc.
In some languages and cultures , you can tell if a word is a person 's name or not by just looking at the spelling or listening to its pronunciation .
There are some other linguistic patterns .
For example , many Chinese names are made up of three syllables .
6 .
Use of names , titles , nicknames , etc.
In some cultures , people use names when they call each other .
In other cultures , people use their nicknames .
In some other cultures , people use their titles -LRB- `` father , '' `` professor , '' etc. -RRB- when they call each other .
7 .
Spelling of names , titles , nicknames , etc.
8 .
Name awareness
Taking note of names is taken a step farther by those who elect to celebrate a name -LRB- e.g. , `` Celebrate Your Name Week '' -RRB- whether their own name , someone else 's name , or names in general , complete ownership of one 's name might very well include celebrating it .
9 .
Middle names
While some people might choose to `` hide '' a middle name for any number of reasons -LRB- i.e. , they consider the middle name they were given to be an `` embarrassment '' -RRB- , others have taken to celebrating their middle name -LRB- e.g. , `` Middle Name Pride Day '' -RRB- .
In the English language , names exclusively are usually pronounced in correlation with the spelling , however can be pronounced as desired , e.g. John is -LRB- jon -RRB- but can also be -LRB- ned -RRB- .
However not probable , is held true in the English rules of grammar .
Sarah , Lucy , Ellen , Claire , Ben .
Names can be shortened e.g. Isabelle can become Izzy or Belle .
Here are some things that are often found in Japanese names today .
In the past , people went by different rules .
1 .
Number of parts of a name
Japanese names have two parts .
One is the family name and the other is the given name .
`` Suzuki Ichiro '' is a name of a Japanese person .
Suzuki is the family name , and Ichiro is the first name .
In the Japanese language , the family name comes first , and the given name comes second .
-LRB- It is like writing Smith John , instead of John Smith . -RRB-
Only some members of the royal family do not have a family name .
2 .
Relations with names of parents and other relatives
A newborn baby gets a family name from their parents .
The parents have the same family name .
So , a son of Ono Yoko -LRB- female -RRB- and Ono Ken -LRB- male -RRB- is Ono something .
The family name Ono is mostly shared by the paternal -LRB- male -RRB- part of the family .
So Ono Ken 's parents have the family name Ono , but Ono Yoko 's parents probably do not .
3 .
Name changes
Names of people change when they marry and divorce .
It is a custom in many parts of the world that women change their family name to that of their new husband when they marry .
However , in Europe and North America especially , many women no longer do this even though their mothers and grandmothers may have .
Sometimes , the man will take the woman 's family name .

Niihau is the smallest of the inhabited islands of Hawaii , in the United States .
It has a land area of 70 sq . miles -LRB- 184 sq . km -RRB- .
It is the oldest of the eight main islands .
The whole island is owned by the Robinson family .
They bought it from the Kingdom of Hawaii for $ 10,000 .
It was said that the buyer , Elizabeth Sinclair -LRB- later Sinclair-Robinson -RRB- , liked the island better than other places such as Waikiki , Pearl Harbor , and the island of Lanai .
There is a small US Navy base where a handful of Navy people work .
The island has a few hundred permanent inhabitants .
Almost all of them are native Hawaiians .
They support themselves largely with small family farms .
Many work for the ranch owned by the Robinsons .
The native Hawaiians lead a rural , low-tech life .
They speak the Hawaiian language and keep traditions alive .
This is because Ms. Sinclair promised to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition when she bought the island .
Niihau is the only one of the Hawaiian islands where the Hawaiian language is the main language .
Niihau is also known as the `` Forbidden Island '' .
This is due to the fact that until recently , the island was off-limits to all but family members , US Navy personnel , government officials and expressly invited guests .
Now , tourists can go on one of a limited number of supervised tours or hunting safaris .
On the beaches of the island are found shells which are the only shells to be classified as gems .
Niihau shells and the jewelry made from them are very popular .
Many , especially those with darker and richer color , are collectors items .
The sale of shells and shell jewelry brings extra money for the local people .
A fishing net is a woven trap usually used to catch fish .
They are usually made out of rope .
A net is a kind of tool .
Internet slang is slang words which are used on the Internet .
Most of these words are new , such as Wiki and blog , which were not used before the Internet became popular .
Some old words were given new meanings , such as mail -LRB- Which now means email -RRB- , and these compare the old communication methods with the new ways using the Internet .
There are many mixed metaphors on the Internet , such as boot -LRB- Which used to mean a shoe -RRB- and link -LRB- Which used to mean a join in a metal chain -RRB- .
Some existing acronyms , such as `` AFK '' -LRB- To mean `` Away from keyboard '' -RRB- and `` IRL '' -LRB- To mean `` In real life '' -RRB- were used on bulletin board systems before the Internet became popular .
These are now used on the Internet , such as in chat rooms and on instant messenger software .
Shorthand is where a word is written in a shorter way because it is quicker and easier to type .
It is also done to fit more text into a limited space .
Internet slang uses many acronyms because they are quicker and easier to type .
They are often shorthand for common phrases and idioms , but they can show somebody 's emotions and their certainty .
Examples : List of Internet slang words Leet speak -LRB- Written as : L33T or 1337 -RRB- is the most common language on MMORPGs because rude words are not stopped by filters .
This language is changing all the time because new words are made and used .
A lot of the words use numbers instead of letters but some were made because of typing errors which are now done on purpose .
Also , some suffixes are used , such as - age and - ness .
Some of the numbers and symbols used instead of letters are in the table below .
Nauru is a small island in the Pacific Ocean .
This one island is one country -LRB- a republic -RRB- .
It sells phosphate -LRB- a chemical -RRB- to Australia .
Nauru is the smallest republic in the world .
English and Nauruan are the official languages of Nauru .
Nauru has no official capital , but its biggest place is Yaren .
There are 14 districts in Nauru :
A noun is a kind of word -LRB- see part of speech -RRB- that is usually the name of a person , place , thing , quality , or idea .
In English , nouns can be singular or plural .
Nouns often need a word called an article or determiner -LRB- like the or that -RRB- .
These words usually do not go with other kinds of words like verbs or adverbs .
-LRB- For example , people do not say `` I will the go to school '' because go is a verb . -RRB-
Adjectives can also describe nouns .
In English , there are more nouns than any other kind of word .
Every language in the world has nouns , but they are not always used in the same ways .
They also can have different properties in different languages .
For example , in some other languages , nouns do not change for singular and plural , and sometimes there is no word for the .
Some examples of nouns in English are : time , people , way , year , government , day , world , life , work , part , number , house , system , company , end , party , information .
The word ` noun ' comes from the Latin nomen meaning `` name . ''
Words like nouns were described in early days by the Sanskrit grammarian PÄ á ini and ancient Greeks like Dionysios Thrax .
In English sentences , nouns can be used as a subject , object , or complement .
They often come after prepositions , as the ` object of preposition ' .
Nouns can sometimes describe other nouns -LRB- such as a soccer ball -RRB- .
When they do this , they are called modifiers .
There are also verb forms that can be used in the same way as nouns -LRB- such as ' I like running . -RRB-
These are called verbals or verbal nouns , and include participles -LRB- which can also be adjectives -RRB- and infinitives .
Nouns are grouped into common nouns , and proper nouns .
There are also pronouns .
These have commonly been considered a different part of speech from nouns , but in the past some grammars have included them as nouns as do many modern linguists .
A proper noun -LRB- also called proper name -RRB- is a name given to individual people , places , companies , or brands .
Some examples of proper nouns are : London , John , God , October , Mozart , Saturday , Coke , Mr. Brown , Atlantic Ocean
Proper nouns begin with an upper case -LRB- capital -RRB- letter in English and many other languages that use the Roman alphabet .
-LRB- However , in German , all nouns begin with an upper case letter . -RRB-
The word `` I '' is really a pronoun , although it is capitalized in English , like a proper noun .
Some common nouns -LRB- see below -RRB- can also be used as proper nouns .
For example , someone might be named ` Tiger Smith ' -- even though he is not a tiger or a smith .
Common nouns are all other nouns that are not proper nouns .
Sometimes the same word can be either a common noun or a proper noun , depending on how it is used ; for example :
In English and many other languages , nouns have ` number ' .
But some nouns are only singular -LRB- such as furniture , physics -RRB- and others are only plural -LRB- such as clothes , police -RRB- .
Also , some nouns are ` countable ' -LRB- they can be counted , for example , one piece , two pieces -RRB- but others are not -LRB- for example , we do not say one furniture , two furnitures -RRB- .
Nouns are words for things , and since things can be possessed , nouns can also change to show possession in grammar .
In English , we usually add an apostrophe and an s to nouns to make them possessive , or sometimes just an apostrophe when there is already an s at the end , like this :
Most adjectives become nouns by adding the suffix ness .
Example : Take the adjective ` natural ' , add ` ness ' to get ` naturalness ' , a noun .

All Wikipedias have a rule that when people write articles , they should use a Neutral Point of View -LRB- abbreviated NPOV -RRB- .
NPOV means that people should write the things that almost everyone agrees about , and make them the main point of the article .
When an article is changed by many people , it usually reflects things that most people agree on .
This is called consensus .
The things that people disagree and argue about must also be mentioned .
But they must not be the main point of the article .
The important issues or debates must be written in a way which does not favor any one side too much .
Strange or rare opinions can be stated as side matters with details about who says them .
If they are too strange , they may be moved .
NPOV does not solve all problems .
For example , many things most people believe are wrong - agreeing is not truth .
Facts must be checked .
Honest people disagree about complex topics .
A Simple English Wikipedia user 's point of view and idea of neutral is not always the same as that of a Simple English Wikipedia contributor .
But most cases are simple :
For example , if two people are talking about a king named Marco -LRB- not a real king , but let 's pretend -RRB- , they might disagree about many things .
One person might say , `` Marco caused a war between countries '' , but the other person might say , `` Marco tried to avoid the war between countries . ''
One person might say , `` Marco was a good king '' .
The other might say `` Marco was a bad king . ''
But both people could agree on a great number of facts about Marco , for example : Marco was 175 centimeters tall .
Marco was born in 1630 and died in 1699 .
Marco 's father was named Carlos and his mother was named Claudia .
Marco 's country fought a war from 1670 to 1675 .
Marco 's Kingdom was Fylburia in Eastern Europe , etc. .
Because almost everyone agrees that these things are true , they are `` neutral point of view '' and okay as the main point of the article .
Only once these things are done should the different opinions on Marco and the war , and his skill as a king , be added - it must be clear that these are not agreed on by everyone , and all sides should be treated fairly .
Opinions should be said like this :
`` Scientists who live in Canada say that Marco was good because -LRB- say their reasons -RRB- .
College students with high grades think he was a bad king , because -LRB- their reasons -RRB- . ''
If you think the view of a topic is not neutral , you may raise a NPOV dispute .
This tells others not to trust the article until it is fixed .
The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans .
Things like the weather , plants , animals , mountains , rivers , the sun and much more are part of nature .
Scientists study the way the parts of nature work .
Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called an artifact .
There are Natural sciences that study different parts of nature .
The science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole , while biology tends to study each of these animals by themself .
In many ways humans and nature can be said to be in conflict .
Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources .
People cut down trees to get wood to burn or to build houses , or to make a place to grow food .
Fires , cars , and factoriescould make a lot of smoke come out of different places , especially in cities .
When people catch a lot of fish , sometimes they kill all the fish or harm the spawning grounds and there are none left .
For instance the trawling method of catching fish very often damages coral that the small fish need to hide from big ones .
People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do .
In the modern world , with many people and many big cities , these problems are becoming more serious .
It takes politics to sort them out fully .
Some types of political parties focus on the idea of natural law , which is that nature shows humans how to do things , and that humans must study nature to sort out all problems .
This is a very old idea , and is part of many ethical traditions .
A natural resource is anything people can use which comes from nature .
People do not make natural resources , but gather them from the earth .
Examples of natural resources are air , water , wood , crude oil , solar energy , wind energy , hydro-electric energy , and coal .
Refined oil is not a natural resource , for example , because people make it .
We often say there are two sorts of natural resource : renewable resources and non-renewable resources .
All places have their own natural resources .
When people do not have a certain resource they need , they can either replace it with another resource , or trade with another country to get the resource .
Some resources are difficult to find , so people sometimes fight to have them -LRB- for example , oil resources -RRB- .
When people do not have some natural resources , their quality of life can get lower .
For example , when they can not get clean water , people may become ill ; if there is not enough wood , trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time -LRB- deforestation -RRB- ; if there are not enough fish in a sea , people can die of starvation .
Some examples of renewable resources are wood , solar energy , trees , wind , hydroelectric power , fish and sunlight .
Non renewable resources can not be recycled .
For example , oil , minerals , and other non renewable resources can not be recycled .
Natural resources are very important to a human lifestyle .
Natural resources are certain materials Earth produces .
Negentropy is reverse entropy .
It means things becoming more in order .
Time in science is defined as the direction of entropy .
This makes it very hard to talk about ideas of time that would apply to negentropy or its effects .
Life is considered to be negentropic because it takes things in less order , like dead food , and turns it into things in more order , like cells in the body , tissues , and organs .
In doing so , it gives off heat .
The outside or skin of an organism is always at maximum entropy because it is removing heat .
Based on several different ideas of entropy , negentropy also would mean several different things .
Cliff Joslyn proposed a list of ways to find entropy in ways other than measuring heat as given off by a body .
Since it is living things looking for these ways , however , and since they create models that are in more order than the measurements they combine , thinking and science are also negentropic â `` just a part of life .
The idea that living things order the universe is called the anthropic principle .
It has a strong form which says that we are needed to do this .
And a weak or obvious form which says if we were not here asking , it would not matter .
Cosmology is concerned with this and other issues of where life fits into models of our universe .
Negentropy is not the only idea about life and how it affects our view of time .
Most of engineering relies on linear time for risk analysis , economics on cyclic time like the business cycle , and biology explores rhythmic time especially in systems of animal communication .
Probably all of these ideas are useful for something , like the many ideas of entropy , and the many ideas of life .
North America is a continent in the Northern and Western halves of Earth , located to the east of the Pacific Ocean , the West of the Atlantic Ocean , the South of the Arctic Ocean , and the North of South America .
It is the northern part of the Americas .
In prehistoric times , North America used to be part of a larger ancient supercontinent named Laurasia .
For other uses , see Neptune -LRB- disambiguation -RRB- .
Neptune , is the eighth and last planet from the Sun in the Solar System .
It is a gas giant .
It is the fourth largest planet and third heaviest .
Neptune has four rings which are hard to see from the Earth .
It is 17 times heavier than Earth and is a little bit heavier than Uranus .
It was named after the Roman God of the Sea .
Neptune 's atmosphere -LRB- a layer of gas floating above planets -RRB- is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium .
It also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue .
Neptune 's blue color is much brighter compared to Uranus ' , which has a similar amount of methane , so there might be another reason why Neptune is blue .
Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system , measured as high as 2,100 km\/h or 1,300 mph .
Neptune was discovered by the astronomers , Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams .
They were both honored for the discovery .
The planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a telescope .
Because of Uranus ' weird movements in its orbit -LRB- the line which a planet follows in moving -RRB- , it made astronomers search for the new planet .
The planet was visited by only one spacecraft , Voyager 2 on August 25 , 1989 .
Neptune once had a huge storm known as the `` Great Dark Spot '' which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2 .
However , the dark spot was not seen in 1994 , and new spots were found since then .
It is not known why the dark spot disappeared .
However , NASA suggested for a future spacecraft to orbit and learn more about Neptune .
The spacecraft was to be shared between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory -LRB- JPL -RRB- and the California Institute of Technology .
The first possible sighting of Neptune is thought to be by Galileo as his drawings showed Neptune near Jupiter .
But Galileo was not credited for the discovery since he thought Neptune was a `` fixed star '' instead of a planet .
Because of Neptune 's slow movement across the sky , Galileo 's small telescope was not strong enough to detect Neptune as a planet .
In 1821 , Alexis Bouvard published the astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus .
Later observations showed that Uranus was moving in an irregular way in its orbit , making some astronomers think of another large body being the cause of the irregular motions of Uranus .
In 1843 , John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of Uranus .
He sent his calculations to Sir George Airy , the Astronomer Royal , who asked Adams for an explanation .
Adams began to make a copy of the reply , but never sent it .
In 1846 , Urbain Le Verrier , who was not working with Adams , created his own calculations but also had problems in encouraging any interest with his people .
However , in the same year , John Herschel began to support the mathematical method and encouraged James Challis to search for the planet .
After much delays , Challis began his unwilling search in July 1846 .
Meanwhile , Le Verrier had convinced Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the planet .
Although Heinrich d'Arrest was still a student at the Berlin Observatory , he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky , in the region of Le Verrier 's predicted area , could be compared with the current sky to look for the displacement characteristic of a planet , as compared to a fixed star .
Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23 , 1846 , within 1 Â of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be , and about 10 Â from Adams ' prediction .
Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August , failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work .
After the news of the discovery of Neptune spread , there was also a lot of arguing between the French and the British about who was to be deserved credit for the discovery .
Later , an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams together deserved credit .
However , historians are now reviewing the topic after the rediscovery in 1998 of the `` Neptune papers '' -LRB- historical documents from the Royal Greenwich Observatory -RRB- , which had seemingly been stolen by astronomer Olin Eggen for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered -LRB- in his ownership -RRB- right after his death .
After reviewing the documents , some historians now think that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier .
Shortly after its discovery , Neptune was temporarily called as `` the planet exterior to Uranus '' or as `` Le Verrier 's planet '' .
The first suggestion for a name came from Galle .
He proposed the name Janus .
In England , Challis suggested the name Oceanus .
In France , Arago suggested that the new planet be called Leverrier , a suggestion which was met with a lot of opposition outside France .
French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus and Leverrier for the new planet .
Meanwhile , on separate and different reason , Adams suggested changing the name Georgian to Uranus , while Leverrier -LRB- through the Board of Longitude -RRB- suggested Neptune for the new planet .
Struve gave support of that name on December 29 , 1846 , to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences .
Soon Neptune was internationally agreed among many people and was then the official name for the new planet .
In Roman mythology , Neptune was the god of the sea , identified with the Greek god , Poseidon .
At 10.243 kg , Neptune 's mass puts the planet between Earth and the largest gas giants ; Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 1\/18th the mass of Jupiter .
Neptune and Uranus are often considered to be part of a sub-class of gas giant known as `` ice giants '' , given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to Jupiter and Saturn .
In the search for extrasolar planets , Neptune has been used as a reference to determine the size and structure of the discovered planet .
Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called as `` Neptunes '' .
just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar `` Jupiters . ''
The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen , with a smaller amount of helium .
A tiny amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere .
Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600 nm , in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum .
This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue .
Because Neptune orbits so far from the Sun , it gets very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at â ' 218 Â C -LRB- 55 K -RRB- .
Deeper inside the layers of gas , however , the temperature rises slowly .
Like Uranus , the source of this heating is unknown , but the differences are larger : Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun , yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System .
Several possible explanations have been suggested , including radiogenic heating from the planet 's core , the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by infalling matter during the planet 's birth , and gravity waves breaking above the tropopause .
The structure of the inside of Neptune is thought to be very similar to the structure of the inside of Uranus .
There is likely to be a core , thought to be about 15 Earth masses , made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock , water , ammonia , and methane .
The heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids , in spite of the large temperatures near the core .
The atmosphere , extending about 10 to 20 % of the way towards the center , is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes .
More mixtures of methane , ammonia , and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere .
Very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior .
The pressure at the center of Neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of Earth .
Comparing its rotational speed to its degree of oblateness shows that it has its mass less concentrated towards the center unlike Uranus .
One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of meteorology activity that has been observed -LRB- seen or measured -RRB- .
When the Voyager spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986 , that winds on that planet were observed to be mild .
When Voyager flew by Neptune in 1989 , powerful weather events were observed .
The weather of Neptune has extremely extremely active storm systems .
Its atmosphere has the highest wind speeds in the solar system , thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat .
Regular winds in the equatorial region have speeds of around 1,200 km\/h -LRB- 750 mph -RRB- , while winds in storm system can reach up to 2,100 km\/h , near-supersonic speeds .
In 1989 , the Great Dark Spot , a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia , was discovered by NASA 's Voyager 2 spacecraft .
The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter .
However , on November 2 , 1994 , the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet .
Instead , a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet 's northern hemisphere .
The reason why the Great Dark Spot 's disappeared is unknown .
One possible theory is that heat transfer from the planet 's core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns .
The Scooter is another storm , a white cloud group more south than the Great Dark Spot .
Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the Voyager encounter in 1989 : it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot .
Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter .
The Wizard 's eye\/Dark Spot 2 is another southern cyclonic storm , the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter .
It originally was completely dark , but as Voyager came closer to the planet , a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images .
Unlike other gas giants , Neptune 's atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below .
Though Neptune 's atmosphere is much more active than that of Uranus , both planets are made up of the same gases and ices .
Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn , but are rather ice giants , meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices .
Neptune is very cold , with temperatures as low as â ' 224 Â C -LRB- â ' 372 Â F or 49 K -RRB- recorded at the cloud tops in 1989 .
Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its magnetosphere , with a magnetic field strongly tilted comparative to its rotational axis at 47 Â and offset at least 0.55 radii -LRB- about 13,500 kilometres -RRB- from the planet 's physical center .
Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets , scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus ' sideways rotational movement .
Very small blue colored rings have been discovered around the blue planet , but they are not well known as the rings of Saturn .
When these rings were discovered by a team led by Edward Guinan , originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings .
However , this was proven wrong by Voyager 2 .
Neptune 's planetary rings have a weird `` clumpy '' arrangement .
Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them .
Proof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid-1980s , when stellar occultation were found to rarely show an extra `` blink '' just before or after the planet occulted the star .
Pictures from Voyager 2 in 1989 solved the problem , when the ring system was found to have several faint rings .
The farthest ring , Adams , has three famous arcs now named LibertÃ , EgalitÃ , and FraternitÃ -LRB- Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity -RRB- .
The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time .
The gravitational effects of Galatea , a moon just inward from the ring , are now thought to have created the arcs .
Several other rings were discovered by the Voyager cameras .
Also with the thin Adams Ring about 63,000 km from the center of Neptune , the Leverrier Ring is at 53,000 km and the wider , smaller Galle Ring is at 42,000 km .
A very small outward expansion to the Leverrier Ring has been named Lassell ; it is surrounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km .
New Earth-based observations published in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune 's rings are a lot more unstable than thought before .
To be exact , it looks like that the LibertÃ ring might disappear maybe quickly in less than 100 years .
The new observations seems to puzzle our understanding of Neptune 's rings into a lot of confusion .
Neptune has a total of 13 known moons .
As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea , the planet 's moons were named after lesser sea gods or goddesses .
The largest , and the only one big enough to have the shape of a sphere is Triton , -LRB- pronounced : Ë traÉ tÉ n -RRB- discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself .
Unlike all other large planetary moons , Triton has a retrograde orbit , showing that the moon was probably captured , and maybe was once a Kuiper belt object .
It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit , and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the Roche limit .
Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system , with temperatures of â ' 235 Â C -LRB- 38 K , â ' 392 Â F -RRB- .
Its diamter is 2700 km , -LRB- 80 % of Earth 's Moon , Luna -RRB- , its mass is 2.15 Ã -- 1022 kg -LRB- 30 % of Luna -RRB- , its orbital diameter is 354,800 km -LRB- 90 % of Luna -RRB- and its orbital period is 5.877 days -LRB- 20 % of Luna -RRB- .
Neptune 's second known moon -LRB- by order of distance -RRB- , the odd moon Nereid , has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the solar system .
From July to September 1989 , Voyager 2 discovered six new moons of Neptune .
Of these , the lumpy-shaped Proteus is the biggest known object that has not been shaped into a sphere by its own gravity .
Although it is the second most massive Neptunian moon , it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton .
Neptune 's closest four moons , Naiad , Thalassa , Despina , and Galatea , orbit close enough to be inside Neptune 's rings .
The next farthest out , Larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star .
The moon was credited for causing Neptune 's ring arcs when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989 .
Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004 .
Neptune can not be seen with naked eye alone , since Neptune 's normal brightness are between magnitudes +7.7 and +8.0 , which can be out-shined by Jupiter 's Galilean moons , the dwarf planet Ceres , and the asteroids 4 Vesta , 2 Pallas , 7 Iris , 3 Juno and 6 Hebe .
A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot , similar in appearance to Uranus .
The blue color comes from the methane in its atmosphere .
Its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually ; most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics .
With an orbital period -LRB- sidereal period -RRB- of 164.88 Julian years , Neptune will soon return -LRB- for discovery -RRB- to the same place in the sky where it was discovered in 1846 .
This will happen three different times , also with a fourth in which it will come very close to being at that position .
These are April 11 , 2009 , when it will be in prograde motion ; July 17 , 2009 , when it will be in retrograde motion ; and February 7 , 2010 , when it will be in prograde motion .
It will also come very close to being at the same point since the 1846 discovery in late October through early-mid November 2010 , when Neptune will turn from retrograde to direct motion on the exact degree of Neptune 's discovery and will then stop for a moment along the ecliptic within 2 arc minutes at that point -LRB- closest on November 7 , 2010 -RRB- .
This will be the last time for about the next 165 years that Neptune will be at its point of discovery .
This is explained by the idea of retrogradation .
Like all planets and asteroids in the Solar System beyond Earth , Neptune goes through retrogradation at certain points during its synodic period .
In addition to the start of retrogradation , other events inside the synodic period include astronomical opposition , the return to prograde motion , and conjunction to the Sun .
In its orbit around the Sun , Neptune will return to its original point of discovery in August 2011 .
Currently , only one spacecraft has visited Neptune .
NASA 's Voyager 2 probe made a quick flyby of the planet with its closest encounter on August 25 , 1989 , and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft .
Some of Voyager 2 `` s important discoveries was its very close fly-by of Triton where took pictures of several parts of the moon .
The probe also discovered the Great Dark Spot , although it has now disappeared after when the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994 .
Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system , it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck .
Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system 's gas giants .
In the outer regions of the solar system , where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth -LRB- still very bright with a magnitude of -21 -RRB- , the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected .
One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun , the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around .
The winds on Jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour .
Rather than seeing slower winds , the scientists found faster winds -LRB- over 1600 km\/h -RRB- on more distant Neptune .
One possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced , turbulence is created , which slows the winds down -LRB- like those of Jupiter -RRB- .
At Neptune however , there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance , and are able to keep very high speeds .
Anyhow , Neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the Sun , and the internal energy source of these winds remains undetermined .
The pictures sent back to Earth from Voyager 2 in 1989 became the basis of a PBS all-night program called Neptune All Night .
New York City is the largest city in the United States .
Over 8 million people live in it , and over 22 million people live in and around it .
It is in the state of New York , which is located in the northeastern United States .
The oldest part of the city , the island of Manhattan , still has its original Lenape Native American name .
Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years , New York City was first explored by Europeans in the 1500 's .
Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer Henry Hudson named the Hudson River in 1609 .
New York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624 .
The Dutch called the whole area of New York `` Nieuw Nederland '' and they named a fort and town on the south end of Manhattan Island Nieuw Amsterdam -LRB- New Amsterdam -RRB- , after the capital city of the Netherlands , which was to become present-day New York .
When the English took over the colony in 1664 they changed the name to New York , to honor the Duke of York , who later became King James II of England .
The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting .
They were afraid of the English Navy so they traded the town to England for the colony of Surinam in South America , which they thought was worth more money .
By the time the English came to New York , there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City , including Breukelen -LRB- Brooklyn -RRB- , Vlissingen -LRB- Flushing -RRB- , and Nieuw Haarlem -LRB- Harlem -RRB- .
There were already some English towns in the area also , such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens .
Dutch and English people had been living together in New York for a long time .
New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city .
Many important battles of the American Revolution were fought in northern Manhattan and in Brooklyn .
New York was the capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1788 .
When the US Constitution was adopted it stayed capital from 1789 until 1790 .
In 1898 , the cities of New York and Brooklyn merged with the Bronx , Staten Island , and the towns in Queens County to form Greater New York .
This is the total area of the City of New York today .
Around this time , many new immigrants came into New York City .
They came in at Ellis Island , an island in New York 's harbor near the Statue of Liberty .
Many of them came to the Lower East Side , which had over a million people living in just a few square miles .
Most of New York City is on three islands near the Atlantic Ocean , although one part is on the mainland of North America .
The city includes all of Manhattan Island and Staten Island , and the western end of Long Island .
There are also many smaller islands .
The city is divided into five major parts called boroughs .
Each one is also a county .
They are :
Water divides a lot of the city .
Part of the Hudson River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side , and the State of New Jersey on the other side .
The East River forms the border between Manhattan on one side , and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side .
The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx -LRB- except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland -RRB- .
Part of Long Island Sound forms the border between the Bronx and Queens .
Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens .
Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water , such as Far Rockaway in Queens and City Island in The Bronx .
A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and it belongs to the United Nations to use for its buildings .
The hallmark of New York city is an enormous number of skyscrapers , especially in Manhattan .
In New York City is located about 5600 skyscrapers and 48 of them are over 200 metres tall , which is the highest number of skyscrapers in one area in the world .
New York City currently has a population of about 8 million people .
Over 18 million people live in the city and nearby areas .
Most of the New York city population since the 1990s belongs to ethnic groups that are minorities in the US .
New York City has had large numbers of immigrants for many years .
In the early 19th Century , they came from Ireland and Germany .
Later in the 19th century , they came from Italy , Russia and Eastern Europe .
Today , they come from Puerto Rico , Haiti , the Dominican Republic and Colombia .
The current mayor of New York is Michael Bloomberg , an Independent .
The city also has a City Council that makes some local laws .
Most laws in New York City are set by the state government in Albany .
Subway transportation is provided by the New York City Subway system , one of the biggest in the world .
Pennsylvania Station , the busiest train station in the United States can be found here .
October is the tenth month of the year .
It has 31 days .
The name comes from the Latin oct for `` eight '' .
It was the eighth month of the year before January and February were added to the beginning of the year .
October begins on the same day of week as January , except in leap years .
October 's flower is the Calendula .
Its birthstone is the opal .
The meaning of the opal is hope .
One -LRB- 1 -RRB- is a natural number after zero and before two .
It represents a single item .
A human typically has one head , nose , mouth , and navel -LRB- or belly-button -RRB- .
The Roman numeral is I.
In mathematics , one is also the only number with this special fact : Any number multiplied by 1 equals that number .
Then , the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any .
The number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it can not be divided by any other number to give one as the answer .
Let n be any number .
Then n\/1 = n but 1\/n is never 1 .
-LRB- When n is not 1 -RRB- Example : 7\/1 = 7 but 1\/7 is not 1 but 0.142857 ...
Any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer .
n\/n = 1 .
-LRB- When n is not 0 -RRB- Example : 7\/7 = 1 .
The number one is important for computer science because it is , together with zero , a part of the binary numeral system .
In machine code and in lots of programming languages one means true .
Zero means false .
O Canada is the national anthem of Canada .
Calixa LavallÃ e wrote the music ; Adolphe-Basile Routhier wrote the words in French .
It was first sung in French in 1880 .
Robert Stanley Weir wrote English words for the song in 1908 .
It was sung as the national anthem for many years before the government made it official in 1980 .
O Canada !
Our home and native land , True patriot love in all thy sons command !
With glowing hearts we see thee rise The True North strong and free , From far and wide , O Canada , We stand on guard for thee .
God keep our land glorious and free !
O Canada , we stand on guard for thee ; O Canada , we stand on guard for thee .
-LRB- `` Canada , our home and the country where we were born , you make all your people truly love you !
With joy we watch you get better and better .
You are the True North , strong and free .
Our citizens come from all over the earth and we watch over you to keep you safe .
God , please keep our land good and free !
O Canada , we watch over you to keep you safe . '' -RRB-
Here are the words in French .
The words in French and English do not mean the same thing .
Ã '' Canada !
Terre de nos aÄ eux , Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux !
Car ton bras sait porter l' Ã pÃ e , Il sait porter la croix !
Ton histoire est une Ã popÃ e Des plus brillants exploits .
Et ta valeur de foi trempÃ e ProtÃ gera nos foyers et nos droits ; ProtÃ gera nos foyers et nos droits .
-LRB- `` Canada , land of our parents and grandparents , you wear a crown of beautiful flowers !
You can carry a sword , and you can carry a cross -LRB- for Christianity -RRB- ; your whole history is full of the great things you have done .
You are brave and faithful , and this will protect our homes and our rights . '' -RRB-
Oahu is the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands , in the United States .
It means `` the gathering place '' -LRB- a place where people meet -RRB- in the Hawaiian language .
Most of the people of Hawaii live there -LRB- 1.2 million of the state 's 1.7 million in the mid-1990s -RRB- .
The total land area is 608 square miles -LRB- 1,556 square kilometres -RRB- .
Honolulu , the capital city of Hawaii , is on this island .
Other well-known places on Oahu are Waikiki , Pearl Harbor , Diamond Head , Hanauma Bay , Kaneohe Bay , and both the North Shore and Makaha -LRB- which are famous for very big ocean waves -RRB- .
Kamehameha I made Oahu his capital when he became the first king of Hawaii .
Iolani Palace was built later on by others of the royal family .
It is the only royal palace on American soil .
Oahu was perhaps the first of the Hawaiian Islands which the crew of HMS Resolution saw on 18 January 1778 .
This was during Captain James Cook 's third Pacific Ocean trip .
Europeans did not land on Oahu until 28 February 1779 when Captain Clerke of the HMS Resolution stepped ashore at Waimea Bay .
Clerke took command of the ship after Captain Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14 .
Today , Oahu has become a tourism and shopping center .
Almost 7 million visitors -LRB- mainly from the American mainland and Japan -RRB- go there every year to enjoy the special island holiday found only in Hawaii .
Oahu can be seen in hundreds of movies and TV shows .
Some of them are Magnum P.I. , `` LOST '' , Hawaii Five-O and Jake and the Fatman .
Open content is when someone creates something and lets others copy it or change it without having to ask for permission .
Any media can be open content , from text and pictures to video and sound .
When someone creates something -LRB- like a picture or book -RRB- , they can make that work `` open '' .
This means that other people are allowed to copy it and change it if they want .
Something that is open content may be free of charge , but it does not have to be .
The Simple English Wikipedia is open content .
So are other Wikipedias .
If a person changes open content or makes new open content , everyone can give it to anyone else , or even sell it .
It is never needed to ask permission to do this , because the people who wrote the text already gave their permission when they clicked the Save button .
The rules that say how people can use , change and pass around open content are called a license .
A license explains exactly what you are allowed to do with the content that falls under it .
Licenses are often written in difficult lawyer language -LRB- `` legalese '' -RRB- , but many licenses have summaries that are much easier to understand .
The makers of open content get to choose what license to use for their work , and everyone else has to follow it .
Only the maker , who owns the copyright , can change it to another license .
Most open content licenses say that when others change the work , they must also declare it to be open and under the same license .
This is called share-alike and means that anything based on work will always be open content .
All the content in Wikipedia is open under the rules of the GNU Free Documentation License , a very well-known open content license .

Orthography , or spelling , is the correct order and combination of letters put together to form words .
Spelling changes over time .
At about the time of the Renaissance , words in English did not have a fixed spelling .
Over time , however , different combinations of letters became more common , resulting in the more standard spellings of words we see today .
Although spelling is not so important as vocabulary and usage , it is a traditional sign of education .
Those who can not spell well may suffer discrimination .
Differences between American English and British English spelling came about mainly as the result of one man .
Noah Webster -LRB- 1758 â `` 1843 -RRB- wrote a Grammar , a Spelling book , and finally an American dictionary of the English language .
In the course of this , he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling .
In his dictionary , he chose s over c in words like defense , he changed the re to er in words like center , he dropped one of the Ls in traveler .
At first he kept the u in words like color or favor but dropped it in later editions .
He also changed tongue to tung : that did not stick .
His main reason was to help children learn to read and write .
Webster 's dictionary contained seventy thousand words , of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before .
Webster did create a slightly different identity for American English .
But , because his efforts left the most glaring problems untackled , his variations make little difference to the way the language is used .
An example of the real problems in English orthography is the word ending - ough , which is pronounced several different ways : tough , bough , cough ... The root causes of spelling variation are historical , and loan words come with their own -LRB- foreign -RRB- spelling .
Either all French loan words should be left as they were , or they all should be changed .
Either we should move wholesale to a more phonetic spelling , or not .
This was proposed by many people since Webster , such as George Bernard Shaw , who proposed a new phonetic alphabet for English .
In some cases Webster 's changes have been widely adopted in Britain : the spelling program came from the French ; US program is clearly simpler , and more consistent with word endings in English .
In our modern world , English orthography is still a problem .
In some countries -LRB- notably , France -RRB- a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling .
English has long escaped from national custody .
Modern British spelling and use was greatly influenced by the two great English dictionaries , Samuel Johnson 's A dictionary of the English language -LRB- 1755 -RRB- , and James Murray 's Oxford English dictionary .
Johnson 's dictionary was hugely influential , abroad as well as at home .
The dictionary was exported to America .
`` The American adoption of the Dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history , but in the history of lexicography .
For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century , Johnson was the authority on language , and the subsequent development of American dictionaries was colored by his fame '' .
p224 For American lexicographers , the dictionary was impossible to ignore : `` America 's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers , Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester , argued fiercely over Johnson 's legacy ... In 1789 -LRB- Webster -RRB- declared that ` Great Britain , whose children we are , and whose language we speak , should no longer be our standard ; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted , and her language on the decline . '
... Where Webster found fault with Johnson , Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his Universal and critical dictionary of the English Language .
p226
Some people argue which language is the easiest to spell .
People who learn a second language tend to think that their first -LRB- native -RRB- language is the easiest .
However , for the learner , programmatic languages , with well-defined rules , are easier to start with than English .
The spelling of the English language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn .
English is , in its origin , a Germanic language .
From its early roots as Anglo-Saxon , it has borrowed words from many other languages : French -LRB- a Romance language -RRB- and Latin are the most frequent donors to English .
Languages that use phonetic spelling are easier to learn to spell than others .
With phonetic spelling the words are spelled as they are pronounced .
The Italian word `` orologio '' for instance is pronounced oh-ro-LO-jo -LRB- `` gi '' always making a `` j '' sound . -RRB-
In English , one comes across the word `` knife '' .
In `` knife '' , the `` k '' is not spoken , even though in English it 's more common to pronounce `` K `` s when they are in words .
One of the problems we have is that similar sounding words may be spelt quite differently .
Rough and ruff ; meet and meat ; great and grate .
Words with complicated spelling may be pronounced simply : Leicester is pronounced ` Lester ' .
Even what rules we do have are frequently broken .
`` i before e except after c '' has over 100 exceptions .
p272 Almost all these problems have come about for historical reasons .
English has been changing for the last thousand years , and as the language changes , so parts of it get stuck with different spellings .
1 .
Originally a 23-letter alphabet for the 35 or so phonemes -LRB- sounds -RRB- of Old English .
Other letters were added later .
2 .
After the Norman conquest , French scribes introduced new spellings .
3 .
Printing .
Many of the early printers came from the continent of Europe , and brought other spelling norms to England .
But , although print stabilised spelling , pronunciation continued to change .
4 .
Printing coincided with the Great Vowel Shift at the end of Middle English -LRB- end 14th to 15th centuries -RRB- .
To avoid complex details , here is what happened : over a century , the pronunciation of all the vowels changed , and is still not standard throughout Britain .
In any event , the spelling of thousands of words now reflects their pronunciation in Geoffrey Chaucer 's time .
5 .
16th-century scholars tried to indicate the history of a word by its spelling : the silent ` b ' in ` debt ' is there to reflect the Latin debitum .
6 .
More loan words added in the late 16th to early 17th century , such as pneumonia , idiosyncrasy , epitome , cocoa .
English has a huge number of words , but its spelling comes from many different sources .
`` The large and varied lexicon of English has been bought at the expense of an increasingly deversified graphology '' .
p275
The word oil is used for many different kinds of liquids .
Oil usually does not mix with water .
Some oils are made from plants and used in foods and for cooking .
Some kinds of plant oils that people use are African oil palm , maize -LRB- corn -RRB- , olive , peanut , soy , and sunflower .
Other kinds of oil are made from crude oil -LRB- petroleum -RRB- which comes from under the ground .
People use large oil wells to bring the oil to the top of the ground .
The oil is sent in special ships called tankers or in pipelines to factories called refineries where it is distilled into LPG , gasoline -LRB- petrol -RRB- , diesel fuel , and fuel oil .
Plastics are also normally made from crude oil .
Oils from crude oil are also used as fuels for engines or to make the parts of machines work together without sticking or stopping .
Different kinds of oils are also used for many other things , for example to make cosmetics , medicines , paints , and detergents , like washing up liquids .
Soap -LRB- s -RRB- are similar to detergents , but they are generally made from animal fat -LRB- s -RRB- rather than oils .
There is also synthetic oil .
An oxymoron is made up of two or more words that seem to be opposite to each other , or actually are opposite .
For example , the words `` Wise fool '' , `` Warm freezer '' , `` Legal murder '' all have two words .
In each one , the one word looks like the opposite of the other word .
You can have words that look opposite , but are right .
For example , a `` warm freezer '' could be right .
A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open .
The word oxymoron is an oxymoron ; ` oxy ' comes from the Greek word that means ` sharp ' , while ` moron ' comes from the Greek word that means ` dull ' .
Words that really are opposite to each other , would be words that just can not be put together .
For example , a `` round square '' could not happen because squares are not round .
Oxymorons sometimes appear in jokes .
Sometimes , the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron .
For example , a joke that says that `` honest politician '' is an oxymoron .
This means that politicians are dishonest , if the word ` politician ' is opposite to ` honest ' .
An operating system -LRB- also called an OS -RRB- is what is needed to run the programs on a computer or a mobile device .
The programs that run on an Operating System talk to the hardware -LRB- Specifically through the BIOS -RRB- .
Microsoft Windows and Mac OS are common operating systems .
Less common , but important operating systems are Linux , Unix , and Solaris .
Most ordinary computer users take their operating system for granted .
The easiest way to understand what an operating system does is to take a close look at what computers were like before operating systems were invented .
The earliest electronic computers did not have any operating system .
If the user wanted to change what the computer was doing , the user had to open the back panel on the -LRB- then very large -RRB- computer , and change how the wires were connected .
Changing what the computer did was very time consuming and required an expert .
Later , computer scientists decided to have the wires stay as they were , and feed instructions to the computer with punch cards -LRB- cards with holes that represented instructions -RRB- or magnetic tape .
The computer would store the instructions in some kind of memory .
This way of operating a computer is called the von Neumann architecture .
Still , computers of the time generally only had enough memory to `` remember '' one program at a time .
If the user wanted the computer to run a different program , the user had to wipe out the first program from memory and then load another program into memory .
Computer operators and computer scientists grew tired of carrying around large stacks of punch cards .
They also wanted computers to run more than one program at a time .
As years of work changed or replaced computers to have more memory , computer operators and computer scientists decided that some computers could hold several programs in its memory .
The computer user could then simply choose which program the user wanted to run .
Running a computer this way requires a `` boss '' program that controls all the other programs , and asks the user what program the user wants to run .
Such a boss program is called an operating system .
Having several programs in memory that can be run at any time makes some new problems .
The operating system itself has to remember where the programs are at in memory .
The operating system also has to prevent two programs from fighting over which one gets to use the processor .
Modern desktop computers need an operating system .
Operating systems generally start up automatically when the user turns on the computer .
A philosophy is a way of thinking about the world , the universe , and about people .
A philosophy is a group of ideas , worked out by a philosopher -LRB- someone who has studied ways of thinking about the world -RRB- .
The ideas in philosophy are abstract , which means that they are `` things that can not be touched . ''
But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world .
Ethics , for example , asks what we should do in our everyday lives , and metaphysics asks about how the world works and of what it is made .
Sometimes people talk about how they have a `` personal philosophy '' , which means the way a person thinks about the world .
This article is not about people 's `` personal philosophies . ''
This article is about the ideas that have been thought about by philosophers -LRB- people who think and write about ways of thinking -RRB- for a long time .
These ideas and questions from philosophy , and many more , have formed a large body of questions and knowledge that are written down in books .
There are many different types of philosophy from different times and places .
Some philosophers came from Ancient Greece , such as Plato and Aristotle .
Others came from Asia , such as Confucius or Buddha .
Some philosophers are from the Middle Ages in Europe , such as William of Ockham or Saint Thomas Aquinas .
Philosophers from the 1600s , 1700s , and 1800s included Thomas Hobbes , RenÃ Descartes , John Locke , David Hume , and Immanuel Kant .
Philosophers from the 1900s included Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jean-Paul Sartre .
The word `` philosophy '' comes from two Greek words which mean ` love of wisdom ' .
Philosophy is the study of humans and the world by thinking and asking questions .
It is a science and an art .
Philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking `` why ? ''
Sometimes , philosophy tries to answer the same questions as religion and science .
Philosophers do not all come up with the same answers to questions .
Some people think there are no right answers in philosophy , only better answers and worse answers .
Philosophy is a way of thinking in the `` middle-ground '' that is between science and religion .
Many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion .
The answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy .
Philosophy can be divided into different groups , based on the types of questions that it asks .
Below is a list of questions split into groups .
One possible list of answers to these questions can be called a ` philosophy ' .
There are many different ` philosophies ' , because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people .
Not all philosophies ask the same questions .
These are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from Europe :
Metaphysics is sometimes split up into ontology -LRB- the philosophy of real life and living things -RRB- , the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of religion ; but these sub-branches are very close together .
Does philosophy do any good ?
Very few people would dispute this .
It is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing , because it helps people to think more clearly .
Philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think .
Philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings wisdom and helps people to learn about the world and each other .
Some philosophers might even argue that the question `` Is philosophy good or bad ? ''
is a philosophical question itself .
However , some people think that philosophy is harmful , as philosophy encourages free-thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold .
For example , philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence , except the meaning that we make up or invent .
People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism .
It should be noted that every major science , including physics , biology , and chemistry are all disciplines that originally were considered philosophy .
As speculation and analysis about nature became more developed , these subjects branched away .
This is a process that continues even today ; psychology only split in the past century .
In our own time , subjects such as consciousness studies , decision theory , and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole .
Because of this , philosophy seems useful because it makes new kinds of science !
Philosophers ask questions about ideas .
They try to find answers to those questions .
Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have .
When they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem , that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people .
Depending on the meaning of the words they use , the answers change .
Some philosophers are full-time thinkers -LRB- called academics -RRB- , who work for universities or colleges .
These philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students .
Other philosophers are just `` hobby '' thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time .
A small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines .
Other people approach philosophy from another job .
For example monks , artists , and scientists may think about philosophical ideas and questions .
Most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions -LRB- meanings -RRB- of words to help them understand what a question means .
Some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means , and that the only thing that makes philosophical questions such as those above difficult is that people do not really know what they mean -LRB- for example Ludwig Wittgenstein -RRB- .
Philosophers will also often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point .
For example , they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like .
Some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer .
This is a process called Occam 's razor .
Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right .
For an example of a philosophical problem , see the God paradox .
Physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts .
Physics is the study of matter and energy in space and time and how they are related to each other .
Physicists assume -LRB- take as given -RRB- the existence of mass , length , time and electric charge and then define -LRB- give the meaning of -RRB- all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units .
Mass , length , time , and electric charge are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined .
In the International System of Units -LRB- abbreviated SI from the French SystÃ me International -RRB- , the metre is the basic unit of length , the kilogram is the basic unit of mass , the second is the basic unit of time , the coulomb is the basic unit of electric charge .
Physics studies how things move , and the forces that make them move .
For example , velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move .
Also , physicists study the forces of gravity , electricity , magnetism and the forces that hold stuff together .
Physics studies very large things , and very small things .
For example , physics studies stars , planets and galaxies and other big pieces of matter .
Physics also studies small pieces of matter , such as atoms and electrons .
Physics also studies sound , light and other waves .
Physics studies energy , heat and radioactivity , and even space and time .
Physics not only helps people understand how objects move , but how they change form , how they make noise , how hot or cold they will be , and what they are made of at the smallest level .
Physics is a quantitative science because it is based on measuring with numbers .
Math is used in physics to make models that try to guess what will happen in nature .
The guesses are compared to the way the real world works .
Physicists are always working to make their models of the world better .
Physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts .
Matter is any physical material in the universe .
Everything is made of matter .
Physics is used to describe the physical universe around us , and to predict how it will behave .
Physics is the science concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern matter , movement and forces , and space and time , and other features of the natural world .
The sweep of physics is broad , from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together , to galaxies and even larger things .
There are only four forces that appear to operate over this whole range .
However , even these four forces -LRB- gravity , electromagnetism , the weak force associated with radioactivity , and the strong force which holds atoms together -RRB- are believed to be different parts of a single force .
Physics is mainly focused on the goal of making ever simpler , more general , and more accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space itself .
One of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to everything in the universe .
In other words , physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define , at the most basic level possible , the behavior of the physical universe .
Physics uses the scientific method .
That is , data from experiments and observations are collected .
Theories which attempt to explain these data are produced .
Physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena , but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave .
Physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong .
The theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called scientific laws .
Of course , all theories , including those known as laws , can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws , when a disagreement with data is found .
Physics is more quantitative than most other sciences .
That is , many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements .
Most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles .
Most of the predictions from these theories are numerical .
This is because of the areas which physics has addressed are more amenable to quantitative approaches than other areas .
Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed , and physics is one of the oldest sciences .
Classical physics normally includes the fields of mechanics , optics , electricity , magnetism , acoustics and thermodynamics .
Modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory , including quantum mechanics , atomic physics , nuclear physics , particle physics and condensed matter physics , as well as the more modern fields of general and special relativity .
Although this distinction can be found in older writings , it is of little recent interest as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields previously considered classical .
There are many approaches to studying physics , and many different kinds of actitivies in physics .
There are two main types of activities in physics ; the collection of data and the development of theories .
The data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment .
For example , condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments .
Experimental physics focuses mainly on an empirical approach .
Sometimes experiments are done to explore nature , and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories .
Some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are primarily observational sciences because most their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation .
Nevertheless , observational programs in these fields uses many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics .
Theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data .
In this way , theoretical physics often relies heavily on tools from mathematics .
Theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories , and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data .
Theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and validate these models .
These two main activities in physics , data collection and theory production and testing , draw on many different skills .
This has led to a lot of specialization in physics , and the introduction , development and use of tools from other fields .
For example , theoretical physicists apply mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computers and computer software in their work .
Experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data , drawing on engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology .
Often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics , and need to be adapted or more advanced versions have to be produced .
There are many famous physicists .
Isaac Newton studied gravity .
Galileo Galilei studied light and how planets move .
Albert Einstein made a theory for how light can make electrons move , and studied how gravity affects light and space .
James Clerk Maxwell proved that light is a type of electromagnetic wave .
Ernest Rutherford said that `` Physics is the only real science .
The rest are just stamp collecting . ''
Politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions .
Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes , cities , or countries .
In large groups , such as countries , some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements .
These people are called politicians .
Politicians , and sometimes other people , may get together to form a government .
The study of politics in universities is called political science , political studies , or public administration .
In everyday life , the term `` politics '' refers to the way that countries are governed , and to the ways that governments make rules and laws .
But politics can also be seen in other groups , too , such as in big companies , schools and churches .
The government tries to lead the whole group .
Governments do things such as :
One of the ways the government leads the group is by making laws and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do .
The government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well-ordered .
The law that `` you must not drink alcohol while driving a car '' stops people from drunk driving , which could kill people .
The law `` you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle '' makes sure that people protect themselves .
The government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws .
Politics is often compared to ethics -LRB- ideas about right and wrong -RRB- .
Ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong .
Ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy , so many people think ethics is not practical .
But without some agreement on ethics , there is probably no way to even have a public debate , a legal system or an election .
There is always some agreement on ethics and personal conduct in a political system .
In most countries , people have formed political partiess to put forward their ideas .
There is usually some disagreement between people within a party , but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things , and they will have more power if they join together .
They agree to take the same position on many issues , and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders .
An election is usually a competition between different parties .
The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote that humans are a political animal and that ethics and politics are closely linked .
Niccolo Machiavelli wrote that politics was firstly about having and keeping power .
He said that without power , a leader could do nothing .
In 1651 , Thomas Hobbes wrote Leviathan , a book about politics .
Hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government .
In the 1800s , John Stuart Mill developed the `` liberal '' idea of politics .
Mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the 1800s .
He said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government .
Bernard Crick wrote a list of the political virtues , which were about best practices of politics itself .
There are also disagreements between different countries .
Attempts to solve the problem with meetings and negotiations are then called diplomacy .
This is just politics between nations instead of politics within nations .
If the problems are very serious or very minor , and they are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they definitely lead to war .
Not to be confused with principal .
A value -LRB- or principle -RRB- usually means an abstract rule , one that can be seen to apply in many experiences , or can be applied by choice in a lot of situations .
It can also mean a moral choice one makes often and consistently , for example , many Buddhists avoid eating meat as a matter of principle .
Many groups of people agree on lists of principles .
They may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply , that is , which principles should be violated before which other ones .
They might also try to list best practices which reflect the principles in the right order , and provide more practical -LRB- less abstract -RRB- instruction .
Profanity is the act of using rude words .
The adjective is profane .
Profanities can also be called swear words , curse -LRB- `` cuss '' -RRB- words , dirty words , bad words , foul language , obscenity or obscene language , or expletives .
It can be called an oath , although this word also has a normal meaning of a `` solemn promise '' .
Religious profanity is called blasphemy .
The verb is to blaspheme and the adjective is blasphemous .
Saying â God !
â or â Jesus Christ !
â as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many people to be blasphemy , mostly because one of the Ten Commandments says not to use the Christian god 's name `` in vain '' -LRB- without a good reason -RRB- .
Swearing oaths can also be considered wrong by some who follow Jesus ' teaching against swearing oaths in the Gospels -LRB- such as Matt .

A profanity usually refers to religion , sex , or bodily functions .
These are things that people feel very strongly about .
In some languages , such as French , there is more profanity about religion than most other topics .
Russian has more about defecation and the lower digestive tract .
A profanity can be a word or gesture or some other form of behavior .
Different words can be profanity to different people , and what words are thought of as profanity in English can change over time .
Whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think .
Some people will be offended by something , while others will not be .
Words which should not be used are taboo words .
Using such words is thought by some people to be a sin .
Some people call profanity `` crude , '' but some say that it is no cruder to say `` damn '' than `` puke '' -LRB- a word that is simply vulgar , but not a swear word -RRB- .
People who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad , and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely , from person to person .
Most often , using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings -LRB- usually unpleasant ones -RRB- , that might otherwise cause a physical reaction .
At other times , some people may use profanity as humor .
Some people develop a mental condition where they use profanity constantly .
This is called coprolalia .
Many people wrongly think this is called Tourette 's syndrome .
Tourette 's syndrome is actually a group of disorders that only includes coprolalia 15 % of the time .
The condition can be aggravate -LRB- made worse -RRB- by stress .
Several of these words come from Anglo-Saxon or Norse names for body parts , and bodily functions .
They came to be thought of as profanity mostly after the Normans brought French and Latin words for them to England .
; Ass or Arse The buttocks or `` butt '' -LRB- from Anglo-Saxon ears -RRB- of a human .

`` Fuck up '' can also mean to make a mistake .
It is often used as a meaningless intensifier , especially in the adverb form -LRB- `` too fucking expensive '' -RRB- , -LRB- `` What the fuck ? '' -RRB- .
Fuck is also used to describe someone under the influence of drugs and or alcohol -LRB- `` they 're Fucked up '' -RRB- .
A person may also be referred to as a Fuck .
The many uses for fuck make it one of the most versatile words in the English language .
For example , `` That fuck Jonathon was so fucked up last night he fucked some fucking whore and got fucking gonorrhea .
Holy fuck ! ''
; Hell The underworld , or a place of punishment in the afterlife for evil , according to many religions .

The People 's Republic of China -LRB- PRC -RRB- -LRB- Chinese language : Simplified Chinese : ä å ä æ ` å
å ' å 1\/2 , Traditional Chinese : ä è ä æ ` å
å ' å -RRB- is a communist-based country in eastern Asia .
It was founded by the Communist Party of China on 1 October , 1949 .
It has the most people of any country in the world -LRB- over 1.3 billion people -RRB- .
It covers an area of 960 million square kilometers .
The capital city is Beijing , and Shanghai is the biggest city .
United Kingdom and Portugal returned Hong Kong and Macao back to China in 1997 and 1999 respectively .
These two cities remain highly autonomous .
The central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for 50 years .
PRC claims Taiwan as one of the many provinces .
However , PRC does not have control of Taiwan which has an entirely different political system and officially known as the Republic of China -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- .
Chinese civilization has been around since the second millennium B.C.E. as a feudal society .
Its land area has mostly looked like that of modern China , except with northern and western edges that varied often .
It has been commonly attacked by the northern people , such as Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan .
While China achieved many things in the First millennium C.E. and early second millennium C.E. , it became an isolationist country in the 15th century C.E.
By the Renaissance , European powers started to take over other countries in Asia .
While China was never actually taken over , many European countries , such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China .
Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries , it had fallen behind other countries in technology , and was helpless to stop this from happening .
This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century .
In 1911 , the monarchy was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen , who started a Nationalist government .
Over time , Marxist philosophies grew under the Nationalist rule .
In 1927 , the Chinese Civil War started , which was fought by the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist leaders .
Mao Zedong gradually took over the power within the Communist Party whose army was called the `` Red Army . ''
At the background , Japan continued to expand their influence and control of north and northeast provinces of China .
The Nationalists and Communists joined to fight Japan .
The conflict became part of , and led to , World War II .
After the war against Japanese , civil war started again .
By 1949 , the Red Army won .
Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan .
Mao Zedong has been in power , although for a long period of time he did not have official position in the government , as the leader of China until he died in 1976 .
During that time , China had bad relations with the Western World .
In the late '60s and early '70s , PRC is even more isolated after the Sino-Soviet Split .
Before Mao died , initial contact with US took place in order to counter the threat from USSR .
All though the initial 30 years of governing , the Communist Party , led by Mao Zedong , has eliminated free-thinking in politics , economics and academic aspects .
The `` peak '' of all these is known as the Cultural Revolution which is a disaster in human history , not only because millions of people were killed , but also because the traditional value system was destroyed as a result .
The Communist Party is still not willing to admit the fault and a lot of criminal actions associated with the Cultural Revolution .
After Mao , Deng Xiaoping , as one of the 1st generation Communist Party leaders , took power and launched the `` Change and Open '' Policy .
In 1979 , because of the overpopulation problem in China , he made the one-child policy , which put a limit on how many children couples can have .
In 1989 , the Chinese government used tanks to stop a protest , killing thousands of people in Beijing 's Tianamen Square .
China also has some problems with news censorship and Internet being blocked by the government .
In August 2008 , China hosted the Summer Olympics for the first time .
There were severe snow storms through out China in the Winter of 2009-2010 .
On 12 October 2009 , Just over 200 herdsmen and 1,000 heads of livestock had been stranded by heavy snowfalls in Ali prefecture , The week-long snowfall had accumulated to about 30 centimetres in Pulan County of Ali , with some areas reaching as much as 1 meter depth , according to Xing Xiuyin , head of an armed police detachment stationed in the Tibetan region .
30 soldiers and two snow-clearing machines were sent on the way to Ali , according to Xing Xiuyin .
Thousands of people were trapped as heavy snow fell in Tibet 's Lhunze County , but rescue services managed to minimize the casualties and housing losses .
The rescue services also managed to provide shelter and emergency fodder for 200 head of cattle .
By October 13 , snow was reported by Chinese authorities to be falling in both Qinghai and Heilongjiang Provinces .
There are 56 recognized minority ethnic minority groups in China .
Han is the largest ethnic group in China -LRB- 92 % of the population -RRB- .
The Communist Party of China controls the government .
Mandarin Chinese is the main spoken language .
Psychoneuroimmunology or mind-body medicine is a view of medicine and health .
It partly explains healing as a process of regaining balances - not as curing .
Disturbing and correcting forces , which may be molecules or hormones , are treated in a more abstract and social way than in most other medicine .
Family and other social network connections play a very major role in healing in this view , and are more important than drugs .
Much biology supports this view .
Some immune system responses can not be explained unless it is strongly linked to the nervous system , and the senses .
Examples are the type of epileptic seizure that can only be triggered by light , or an allergy that goes off if only a few molecules , not even enough to smell , are received into the nose .
Also there are cases of people with HIV who have lived a very long time - with almost no functioning immune system - only their positive attitude seems to make them different from those who die .
Sometimes the whole system is compared to a symphony orchestra in your body .
There are different types of instruments playing , in sections , which are like the different systems in your body .
Rhythm and overall level of stress matter much more than how any individual part of the system works .
Rest and sleep matter a great deal , just as they would for symphony players .
An important difference between this view and other medicine is that someone is not just `` sick '' until they are `` well '' , but will go through periods of time feeling sick , and feeling well , as a part of the rhythms starting to work .
So a child for instance should not just go to bed and stay there for a period of time , but should be able to get up and do things , even if they have to go back to bed quickly afterward to rest some more .
Dr. Esther Sternberg , an expert in this field , believes that the body has its own internal way of restoring its balance and that doctors usually can not improve these .
In 500 BC , she says , it was common to build temples to Asclepius , the god of healing , and they had long sloping ramps to let sick people use them .
There were hospital like cells , and healthy food and fresh water was served .
Removing day to day stress , getting enough sleep , and music , dreams , exercise , nutrition , prayer , and interaction with others , was all part of the method .
Advocates of this approach to healing believe that modern hospitals are making mistakes by isolating the sick unless they are infectious - which is good for others but not necessarily for the sick themselves .
A political party is an organized group of voters .
It often puts forward candidates for public office .
In a democracy , leaders must `` run for office '' in an election .
In a dictatorship , there is generally only one party allowed , that can approve a new leader without non-members having a choice .
A political party is similar to a faction , and can be the same thing .
In some systems , members of one party in the legislature are all expected to vote the same way .
The laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country , so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats , gets to run the government .
The next largest party is often called the `` opposition '' .
Sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats , no one party has over half of the seats .
Then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a `` coalition '' .
Some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group .
Others form policies to address all matters of government , known as a `` platform '' .
Many political parties have a set of ideas and beliefs -LRB- called its `` ideology '' -RRB- .
People often describe these ideologies using words such as `` rightwing '' and `` leftwing '' .
Common ideologies include environmentalism , socialism -LRB- ranging from social democracy to Marxism and Communism -RRB- , conservatism , democracy , liberalism , and nationalism .
Political parties can be against the law in some places .
When some parties get a lot of power , they can make all other political parties illegal .
For example , the Nazi Party did this in Germany , and the Communist Party did it in several countries .
Some countries make extreme-right parties illegal -LRB- such as Vlaams Blok in Belgium -RRB- .
At other times , countries have outlawed far-left parties .
For example , West Germany banned the Communist Party in 1956 .
A handful of countries like China , North Korea and Cuba still have one-party dictatorships .
In a few other dictatorships , such as Saudi Arabia , all political parties are banned and there is no parliament at all .
In all big democratic countries , parties are very important .
But there are a few very small countries , such as the island of Jersey , where most politicians do not belong to any party and where parties do not matter much .
In some democracies , there are only two big political parties .
For example , in the United States , there is the Democratic Party and the Republican Party .
Some other parties exist but are very small and do not hold seats in Congress .
In other countries there are larger numbers of parties .
In the German federal Parliament -LRB- or Bundestag -RRB- , six parties have seats .
In the United Kingdom , there are two big parties , one medium-sized party , and many small ones .
The polymer used for plastic bottles , clothes and other things is at Polyethylene terephtalate A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people , but is not forced to work and is not eaten , in most instances .
In most cases , a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship .
Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of it .
If no one adopts it or the pet is too old\/sick , the pet may be killed .
Dogs , cats , fish , birds are the most common pets in North America .
Horses , elephants , oxen , and donkeys are usually made to work , so they are not usually called pets .
Some dogs also do work for people , and it was once common for some birds -LRB- like falcons and carrier pigeons -RRB- to work for humans .
Rodents are also very popular pets .
The most common are guinea pigs , rabbits , hamsters -LRB- especially Syrians and Dwarfs -RRB- , mice and rats .
The cap ` tchi tribe in Sudan is known for the ritual burning of domesticated animals that are considered too sacred to eat .
Platonic realism -LRB- also called Platonism or Anti realism -RRB- is the philosophical idea that one must try to know about perfect things , even though you know that they do not exist and may not be able to be understood .
It is named after the philosopher Plato .
Plato thought that goodness was part of reality , but was part of a parallel ` perfect ' universe .
Plato thought it was the job of the philosopher to look for reflections of these perfect things in our universe and to teach others about what they found .
In philosophy of mathematics , someone is called a Platonist if they believe a mathematical proof is part of reality , but also that it is not part of our universe but a parallel ` perfect ' one .
Mathematical Platonists also believe that numbers are not related to things in our universe , and that even if there was never a group of one million things that the number one million would still be a real number .
Some think this idea affects our ideas about money -LRB- economics -RRB- and our ideas of time .
It is hard to say if this is true , since platonism is so basic in the Western culture .
Plato and his student Aristotle had many ideas which are still the most important in this culture .
It is hard to say if this one was critical .
God 's eye view may be more important , especially in politics .
Today , Platonism is mostly considered a philosophy of mathematics but not of science or reality in general .
This might under-estimate its effects .
But no one calls themselves Platonist other than a few mathematicians today .
A paradox is a sentence in logic that can not be true but also can not be false .
Many famous problems of this kind exist .
One of most famous paradoxes is called the liar 's paradox .
It is the simple sentence `` This sentence is a lie . ''
If the sentence is true , then it is a lie , as it says .
But if it is a lie , how can it be true ?
A lie can not also be the truth .
So the sentence being true makes it a lie .
If the sentence is a lie , then it is not as it says , it is true .
But that is just what the sentence says .
So that makes it true .
So the sentence being a lie makes it true .
This paradox is not just true in English but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself .
This is true of mathematics as well .
Paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself .
Another example is the statement that there is no cabal .
Only a cabal can know if there is no cabal , so this is either a guess , or , it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist .
A paradox can also arise in ethics .
Taking power over others is often also required to protect them , but also , one of the things being protected is their ability to do as they please , which this power interferes with .
There is another article on ethical dilemma which means `` a paradox arising in ethics '' .
Because a paradox forces us to think `` out of the box '' , about possibilities other than true or false in logic , right or wrong in morality , it is considered very important in education .
People who do not see a paradox where others do , are likely to be too certain they are right .
A potato is a type of vegetable .
The scientific name of the potato plant is Solanum tuberosum .
It contains a lot of starch and other carbohydrates .
It is a small plant with large leaves .
The part of the potato that people eat is a tuber that grows under the ground .
It usually has a brown or pink skin and is white or yellow inside .
If it gets light on it , the tuber turns green and will be poisonous .
The potato is from the high and cool areas of the Andes of Peru .
It began to be grown as a food crop more than 7,000 years ago .
When the Europeans came to South America in the 1500s they took the potato back to Europe .
It took nearly 200 years for the potato to become a widely grown crop .
In the 1780s the farmers in Ireland began growing potatoes because they grew well in the poor soils .
They also have most of the vitamins that people need to survive .
The Irish became so dependent on the potato that when the crop failed in 1845 there was a famine and many people starved to death .
The potato plant is now grown in many different parts of the world .
Captain William Bligh planted potatoes on Bruny Island , Tasmania in 1792 .
In Australia they are now the largest vegetable crop .
There are now many different types of potato .
These have names such as :
Scientists in Germany have used genetic engineering to make a potato called the Amflora , which could be grown to make starch for making other things in factories .
The potato is not very good to eat unless it is cooked .
People cook potatoes by boiling , roasting , or frying them .
French fries or `` chips '' are potatoes cut into long pieces and fried until they are soft .
Potato chips , often called crisps , are potatoes cut into very thin round pieces and fried until they are hard .
William Shakespeare wrote that the potato was an aphrodisiac , but there is no evidence to show this is true .
Plants are one of five big groups -LRB- kingdoms -RRB- of living things .
They are autotrophic eukaryotes , which means they have complex cells , and make their own food .
Usually they can not move -LRB- not counting growth -RRB- .
Plants include familiar types such as trees , herbs , bushes , grasses , vines , ferns , mosses , and green algae .
The scientific study of plants , known as botany , has identified about 350,000 extant species of plants .
Fungi and non-green algae are not classed as plants .
Most plants grow in the ground , with stems above , and roots below .
Water and some nutrients come from the roots .
The evaporation of water from pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant .
This is called transpiration .
A plant needs sunlight , carbon dioxide , minerals and water to make food .
A green substance in plants called chlorophyll traps the energy from the Sun needed to make food .
Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves , inside plastids , which are inside the leaf cells .
The leaf can be thought of as a food factory .
Leaves of plants vary in shape and size , but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy .
Once the food is made in the leaf , it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots .
The word `` plant '' can also mean to put something in the ground .
For example , farmers plant seeds in the ground .
At least some plant cells contain photosynthetic organelles -LRB- plastids -RRB- which enable them to make food for themselves .
With sunlight , water , and carbon dioxide , the plastids make sugars , the basic molecules needed by the plant .
Free oxygen -LRB- O2 -RRB- is produced as a by-product of photosynthesis .
Later , in the cell cytoplasm , the sugars may be turned into amino acids for proteins , nucleotides for DNA and RNA , and carbohydrates such as starch .
This process needs certain minerals : nitrogen , potassium , phosphorus , iron and magnesium .
Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth .
The roots of plants perform two main functions .
First , they anchor the plant to the ground .
Second , they absorb water and various nutrients dissolved in water from the soil .
Plants use the water to make food .
The water also provides the plant with support .
Plants that lack water become very limp and their stems can not support their leaves .
Plants which specialise in desert areas are called xerophytes .
Water is transported from the roots to the rest of the plant through special vessels in the plant .
When the water reaches the leaves , some of it evaporates into the air .
Many plants need the help of fungi to make their roots work properly .
This plant\/fungi symbiosis is called mycorrhiza .
Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules help some plants get nitrogen .
Flowers are the reproductive organ only of flowering plants -LRB- Angiosperms -RRB- .
The petals of a flower are often brightly colored and scented to attract insects and other pollinators .
The stamen is the male part of the plant .
It is composed of the filament -LRB- a stalk -RRB- that holds the anther , which produces the pollen .
Pollen is needed for plants to produce seeds .
The carpel is the female part of the flower .
The top part of the carpel contains the stigma .
The style is the neck of the carpel .
The ovary is the swollen area at the bottom of the carpel .
The ovary produces the seeds .
The sepal is a leaf that protects a flower as a bud .
The process by which pollen gets transferred from one flower to another flower is called pollination .
This transfer can happen in different ways .
Insects such as bees are attracted to bright , scented flowers .
When bees go into the flower to gather nectar , the spiky pollen sticks to their back legs .
The sticky stigma on another flower catches the pollen when the bee lands or flies nearby it .
Some flowers use the wind to carry pollen .
Their dangling stamens produce lots of pollen that is light enough to be carried by the wind .
The stigmas of these flowers are feathery and hang outside the flower to catch the pollen as it falls .
A plant produces many spores or seeds .
Lower plants such as moss and ferns produce spores .
The seed plants are the Gymnosperms and Angiosperms .
If all the seeds fell to the ground besides the plant , the area might become overcrowded .
There might not be enough water and minerals for all the seeds .
Seeds usually have some way to get to new places .
Some seeds can be dispersed by the wind or by water .
Seeds inside juicy fruits are dispersed after being eaten .
Sometimes , seeds stick to animals and are dispersed that way .
A prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen .
It is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these future events .
Predictions are based on the idea that two beginning positions that are like each other will have similar results .
By watching something happen , it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens .
Predictions are given by science or fortune tellers or horoscopes .
The most common example of a prediction is the weather forecast .
Studying how weather happens lets people predict what the weather will be by looking at what is currently happening .
This is helpful because by knowing that it is going to rain , a person can wear the right clothes for it .
Nostradamus has made many predictions about future .
Probability is a part of mathematics .
It has to do with chance , the study of things that might happen or might not happen .
For example , using probability , you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land , half of the time it will land with one side facing up , and half the time with the other side facing up .
Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side , and something else on the other side .
Often people call the side with the face `` heads '' , and the other side `` tails '' .
The probability -LRB- p -RRB- of an event is always between zero -LRB- impossible -RRB- and one -LRB- certain -RRB- .
If we roll a die -LRB- plural : dice -RRB- , then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1\/6 -LRB- This is because there are 6 numbers on a die -RRB- .
Also , the chance it will land on 2 is 1\/6 .
This is because it can land on 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 .
The chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1 .
Every time we roll the die , it will always land on a number between 1 and 6 .
Probability can be figured out using math .
For example if you roll six dice , the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious , but can be figured out using math and science .
Proteins are large molecules built from small units known as amino acids .
These small pieces are stuck together with peptide bonds .
They do different things depending on their shape .
They can be found in meat or muscle .
They are used for growth and repair , as well as for strengthening the bones .
They help to make tissue and cells .
They can be found in animals , plants , fungi , bacteria , and also in the human body .
For example , muscles contain a lot of proteins .
Body builders will eat foods with a lot of protein because exercise breaks down the muscles , allowing new protein to be used to rebuild them larger and stronger .
Proteins form an important part in foods like milk , eggs , meat , fish , beans , and nuts .
There are four things that determine what a protein will do .
The first is the order that the amino acids are in .
There are 20 amino acids , and they are all a bit different .
The second is the little twists in the chain .
The third is how the entire thing is folded up .
The fourth is whether it 's working with other proteins .
Animals eat proteins and break them down into amino acids in order to recombine them into other things needed , including other proteins and other amino acids .
Animals have certain amino acids they are not able to create this way , and must get from their food .
These are called `` essential amino acids '' and different animals have different amino acids they are not able to create .
Meat contains all the essential amino acids humans need ; most plants do not .
However , eating a mixture of plants , such as both wheat and peanut butter , or rice and beans , provides all the essential amino acids needed .
Soy products like tofu provide all the essential amino acids but are not the only way to get the protein you need .
Amino acids are used to build new proteins that are used as enzymes , hormones , or antibodies .
Protein is very important to have in your diet ; it 's basically what you are made of .
Proteins are essential for life .
The scientist Jons Jacob Berzelius gave proteins their name , but many other scientists have studied proteins .
The periodic table of the chemical elements is a list of known atoms -LRB- chemical elements -RRB- .
In the table the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number .
The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of electrons or protons in that particular atom .
In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups .
A row of elements across the table is called a period .
Each period has a number : from 1 to 7 .
Period 1 has only 2 elements in it : hydrogen and helium .
Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements .
Other periods are longer .
A column of elements down the table is called a group .
There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table .
Each group has a number : from 1 to 18 .
Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways , which gives them similar chemical properties -LRB- they behave in similar ways -RRB- .
For example , group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms .
The periodic table can be used by chemists to observe patterns , and relationships between the elements .
For example , elements to the top and far left of the table are the most metallic , and elements on the bottom right are the least metallic .
-LRB- e.g. lithium is much more metallic than xenon -RRB- .
There are also many other patterns and relationships .
There are three systems of group numbers ; one using Arabic numerals -LRB- 1,2,3 -RRB- and the other two using Roman numerals -LRB- I , II , III -RRB- .
The Roman numeral names were used at first and are the traditional names ; the Arabic numeral names are newer names that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -LRB- IUPAC -RRB- decided to use as well .
The IUPAC names were meant to replace the older Roman numeral systems as they used the same names to mean different things , which was confusing .
The Periodic Table was invented and arranged by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev -LRB- 1834-1907 -RRB- .
The color of the number -LRB- atomic number -RRB- above the element symbol shows the state of the element at normal conditions .
Physiology is the study of how living things work .
Physiologists can study how parts or organs of an organism work with together to make things happen .
In human beings , for example , the digestion of food hormones and other chemicals made by the stomach , liver , and pancreas .
Muscle contraction happens because of chemical messages made by nerves of that muscle .
By learning how the body functions normally , physiologists and physicians can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally .
For example , an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in treating goitre .
Studies of the circulatory system and the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses like heart disease , stroke , and high blood pressure .
A planet is a large object such as Earth or Jupiter that orbits a star .
It is smaller than a star , and it does not make light .
Planets are ball-shaped -LRB- spheres -RRB- .
Objects that orbit planets are called moons .
There are eight planets in the Solar System .
Pluto used to be known as a planet , but in August 2006 , the International Astronomical Union decided it was a dwarf planet instead .
There are four more known dwarf planets , Ceres , Makemake , Eris and Haumea .
The name `` planet '' is from the Greek word Ï Î '' Î Î 1\/2 Î Ï Î Ï -LRB- planetes -RRB- , meaning `` wanderers '' , or `` things that move '' .
Until the 1990s , people only knew of those in the Solar System .
As of January 2007 , we know of 209 other planets .
All of the newly found planets are orbiting other stars : they are extrasolar planets .
Sometimes people call them `` exoplanets '' .
The planets in the Solar System have names of Greek or Roman gods , apart from Earth , because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times .
However , Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god : Terra .
Other languages , for example Chinese , use different names .
Moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology , or from the plays of Shakespeare .
Here is a list of planets in the Solar System .
They are ordered by how close they are to the Sun , nearest first .
Astronomers speak about major -LRB- or true -RRB- planets , and minor planets , which are smaller objects that go around the Sun .
Some examples of `` minor planets '' are asteroids , comets , and trans-Neptunian objects .
Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also `` icy '' .
Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System -LRB- like Triton -RRB- .
The police are a group of people whose job it is to enforce laws , arrive at and investigate crimes and protect the public .
People who work for the police are called police officers and work out of a police station .
The police have different powers to help them do their job .
These powers are different in different countries , but most police officers have the power to arrest people , search people and their houses and carry equipment such as guns , batons\/truncheons or pepper spray or all of them .
The area where a police officer can use these powers is called jurisdiction .
If he goes outside of his jurisdiction , he is no longer allowed to use his powers .
Other police have to then take over and maybe even if this officer has gone passed their power greatly the power of high officer can take the officers badge away
Most police departments have most of their officers in two main groups : a `` patrol '' group that has officers who wear uniforms , and a `` detective '' group that has officers who wear normal clothing .
Also , not all countries use the same words to describe these groups .
In the United Kingdom , for example , patrol officers form the `` uniform branch '' , while detectives work within the CID -LRB- `` Criminal Investigation Department '' -RRB- .
Police uniforms , equipment and methods can change a lot depending on the country .
Different countries have different names for their police .
In Ireland they are called the Garda and in Russia they are called the Militsiyaner .
Other names for police services are sheriff 's office , marshal 's office or department of public safety .
In the same country there can be different types of police officer who have powers in different areas and situations , such as state police , military police and local police .
In most countries , police officers have been trained to carry guns .
Even in countries like the United Kingdom , New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland where most police officers do not carry guns , more are being trained to do so because gun crime is getting worse .
Firearms training teaches that the use of a firearm is only when lives are at risk .
Even if they do not carry guns , police almost always carry some or all of these things :
A proper noun is a noun that has the first letter capitalized .
Names of places and people are proper nouns .
Example : `` My name is Leonardo . ''
A plastic is a material that can change its shape , so many things can be made of plastic .
There are many types of plastic .
Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made ; then they become hard afterwards .
Others can be changed by heating them up or even by melting them .
Most plastics are man-made ; they do not occur in nature .
They are often made from oil that comes out of the ground .
The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated .
Most of the materials that are called plastic are polymers .
Polymers are long chains of atoms bonded to one another .
People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time .
Alexander Parkes , an English inventor -LRB- 1813-1890 -RRB- , created the earliest form of plastic in 1855 .
It was hard but flexible and transparent , and he called it `` Parkensine . ''
Plastic is filling up the landfills and sometimes if you burn them , they release toxic fumes .
If you do not recycle , it becomes waste .
Product stewardship includes waste disposal measures in the distribution chain of an industrial product .
That is , paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product , and relying on those who sold it to you , to dispose of it .
The slightly more specific idea of product take-back means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of purchase .
It is often applied to paint , tires , and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly .
It is most familiar as the deposit bottle - where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it .
The container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to buy the bottle , separately from the fee to buy what it contains .
If one returns the bottle , the fee is returned , and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling .
If not , one has paid the fee , and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle .
Also , since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle , it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving .
This is quite common for instance among homeless people in U.S. cities .
Legal requirements vary : the bottle itself may be considered simple property of the purchaser of the contents , or , the purchaser may have some obligation to return the bottle to some depot so it can be recycled or re-used .
For the more toxic items , it is more likely that returning it is required :
This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires .
When purchasing paint or tires in many places , one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become .
In some countries , such as Germany , law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction , production , distribution , use and waste of a product , and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way .
This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally .
In the United States , there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability - holding companies responsible for things the product does , which it was never advertised to do .
Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits , many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting .
This is the financial reflection of the comprehensive outcome - noting the gains and losses to all parties involved , not just those investing or purchasing .
Such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive , as it avoids liability and future lawsuits .
So these are partial implementations of a strict service economy ideal .
Those who advocate these measures are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process .
It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of -LRB- fictional , national , legal -RRB- `` commodity '' and `` product '' relationships .
Peace is a time without any fights or wars .
In a larger sense , peace -LRB- or peacefulness -RRB- can mean a state of harmony , quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all , like a still pond with no ripples .
Peace within and among states is a goal of many people and organizations .
One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the League of Nations after World War I. When it failed to stop World War II , it was replaced by the United Nations which tries to make the world peaceful by standing for collective security between all the members .
This means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first , the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first .
This idea was used by the United Nations to defend both South Korea and Kuwait when they were attacked .
Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in a letter he sent from the Birmingham jail that , `` True peace is not merely the absence of tension : it is the presence of justice . ''
In other words , Real peace is more than just problems being gone : there must be fairness to have peace .
Alfred Nobel created an annual award , the Nobel Peace Prize , for the person who had done the most to bring peace to the world .
Buddhists think that peace can be gotten once all suffering ends .
To get rid of suffering and get this peace , they follow a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths â '' a central tenet to their philosophy .
Jews and Christians believe that true peace comes from a personal relationship with God .
Jesus Christ -LRB- also called the `` Prince of Peace '' in the Book of Isaiah -RRB- said : `` Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give you .
I do not give to you as the world gives .
Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid . ''
Inner peace -LRB- or peace of mind -RRB- refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace , with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress .
Being `` at peace '' is considered by many to be healthy and the opposite of being stressed or anxious .
Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness .
Peace of mind , serenity , and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress .
In some cultures , inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training , such as prayer , meditation , T ` ai Chi Ch ` uan or yoga , for example .
Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself .
Finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism .
A peace movement is a social movement that seeks to get ideals such as the ending of a particular war -LRB- or all wars -RRB- , minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation , often linked to the goal of achieving world peace .
Means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of pacifism , non-violent resistance , diplomacy , boycotts , moral purchasing , supporting anti-war political candidates , demonstrations , and lobbying to create legislation .
Many different theories of `` peace '' exist in the world of peace studies , which involves the study of conflict transformation .
The definition of `` peace '' can vary with religion , culture , or subject of study .
Peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others , where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences , tolerance persists , conflicts are resolved through dialog , people 's rights are respected and their voices are heard , and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension .
Quebec -LRB- spelled QuÃ bec in French -RRB- is a province in Eastern Canada .
It is the biggest of Canada 's ten provinces .
It is the province with the second-highest number of people .
Most of Quebec 's inhabitants live along or close to the banks of the Saint Lawrence River .
Not many people live in the north part of the province .
Unlike the other provinces , most people in Quebec speak French .
There is a strong French-language culture , which includes French-language newspapers , magazines , television and radio shows , and movies .
The government of Quebec has its offices in the capital , Quebec City , one of the oldest cities in North America .
The largest city in Quebec , and the second-largest city in Canada , is Montreal .
Quebec has many natural resources that are used to create jobs .
Quebec also has many companies that create products for information and communication technologies , aerospace , biotechnology , and health industries .
It has also developed close relations with the Northeastern United States .
Quebec was part of New France until 1760 .
Quebec became a province in the Canadian Confederation in 1867 .
Since then , some people in Quebec have wanted to leave Canada .
Since Quebec is a mainly French-speaking province , most of people there feel that it is very different from the rest of Canada , and a select few are proud of this difference and want to keep it that way .
They feel that for this to happen , Quebec must leave Canada and become its own country .
However , the people of province are still divided as to it 's place in Canada .
Quebec people held democratic votes in 1980 and 1995 to decide whether to leave Canada .
In 1995 , the people of Quebec voted on the question , and chose to stay in Canada by a one percent margin .
Aboriginal people and Inuit groups were the first peoples who lived in what is now QuÃ bec .
These Aboriginal people lived by hunting , gathering , and fishing .
Some of the Aboriginal people , called Iroquoians , planted squash and maize .
The Inuit fish and hunt whales and seals for fur and food , and they sometimes warred with each other .
Vikings came in longboats from Scandinavia in 1000 BC .
Basque whalers and fishermen traded furs with Aboriginal people throughout the 1500s .
The first French explorer to reach Quebec was Jacques Cartier .
He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1534 and established a colony near present-day Quebec City .
Samuel de Champlain came from France and traveled into the St. Lawrence River .
In 1608 , he founded Quebec City as a permanent fur trading outpost .
Champlain signed trading and military agreements with the Aboriginal people .
Voyageurs , coureurs des bois , and Catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the North American continent .
After 1627 , King Louis XIII of France made a rule that only Roman Catholics could go to live in New France .
Jesuit clerics tried to convert New France 's Aboriginal people to Catholicism .
New France became a Royal Province of France in 1663 .
The population grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760 .
Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River .
In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British Ohio Country .
Britain asked the French to remove the forts , and the French refused .
By 1756 , France and Britain were at war .
In 1758 , the British attacked New France by sea and captured the French fort at Louisbourg .
In 1759 , British General James Wolfe defeated General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm outside Quebec City .
France gave its North American land to Great Britain in 1763 .
In 1764 , New France was renamed the Province of Quebec .
In 1774 , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act giving recognition to French law , Catholic religion and French language in the colony .
The Quebec Act gave the Quebec people their first Charter of rights .
The Quebec Act made American colonists angry , so they launched the American Revolution .
A 1775 invasion by the American Continental Army was stopped at Quebec City .
In 1783 , Quebec gave the territory south of the Great Lakes to the new United States of America .
In 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act , which brought most of the provinces together .
The conservative government of Maurice Duplessis dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Catholic church .
The Quiet Revolution was a period of social and political change .
During the Quiet Revolution , English Canadians lost their control over the Quebec economy , the Roman Catholic Church became less important , and the Quebec government took over the hydro-electric companies .
In 1963 , a terrorist group that became known as the Front de LibÃ ration du QuÃ bec -LRB- FLQ -RRB- began doing bombings , robberies and attacks on government offices .
In 1970 , the FLQ kidnapped and killed James Cross , the British trade commissioner to Canada , and Pierre Laporte , a provincial minister and Vice-Premier .
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act , and 497 people were arrested .
The Quiet Revolution was so named because it was not marked by protests or violence .
In 1977 , the newly elected Parti QuÃ bÃ cois government of RenÃ LÃ vesque introduced the Charter of the French Language .
Often known as Bill 101 , it defined French as the only official language of Quebec .
A religion is a set of beliefs that is held by a group of people .
There are many different religions , each with a different set of beliefs .
The beliefs are about the world and the people in it , about how they came into being , and what their purpose is .
These beliefs are often linked to `` supernatural '' beings such as god , a number of gods or spirits .
They may also be linked to an idea such as a path that the spirit of each person should take towards goodness , truth and duty .
Each religion has different ideas about these things .
Each religion also has a `` moral code '' which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act .
Each religion usually has their own type of `` devotions '' when people worship or pray .
They often have rituals -LRB- special things that are always done in the same way -RRB- for certain times of the year or certain times of a person 's life .
Other words that are used for `` religion '' are `` faith '' and `` belief system '' .
Jainism , Tenrikyo , Wicca , Zoroastrianism , and Pantheism .
People who do not believe in any religion are called atheists .
People who say that they are not sure whether they believe or not are called agnostics .
In many religions , one of the main beliefs is that there is a `` deity '' -LRB- or god -RRB- who is a great creator spirit .
In many religions , there is just one deity that the people believe in .
In other religions there are many deities who each have different roles in the universe .
In many religions there are other types of spirits .
These may include angels , devils and other such things which can be both good and bad .
Giving honor to God , the gods or the spirits is an important part of most religions .
While this may often be done privately , it is also often done with gatherings of people and rituals .
These rituals are often based on old traditions , and may have been done in almost the same way for hundreds , or even thousands of years .
Another main belief is that humans have a `` soul '' or spirit which lives on after their body has died .
The person 's spirit is on a journey through life that continues after death .
Most religions believe that what a person does during their lifetime will affect what happens to their spirit in the afterlife .
Many religions teach that a good person 's spirit can reach a special place of peace and happiness like Heaven or Nirvana , and that a bad person 's spirit can travel to a place of pain and suffering like Hell .
Still other religions believe in reincarnation - that instead of going either to Heaven or Hell , spirits of the dead return to earth in a new body .
`` Morals '' are the way a human behaves to other humans .
Most religions make rules about human morals .
The rules of how people should act to each other are different in different religions .
For some religions , following a `` path '' of goodness , truth and duty is very important .
This is called Tao in the teachings of Buddha .
In the teachings of Judaism , people were told to `` love your neighbor as yourself '' .
In the teachings of Jesus , people were told to think of every single person as their `` neighbor '' and treat them with love .
Not every religion teaches people to be kind to all other people .
In many religions it has been common for people to believe that they have to act kindly only to some people and not to others .
In some religions , many people believe that they can please a god or spirit by killing or sacrificing another person .
A religion is passed on from one person to another through teachings and stories -LRB- which are often called `` myths '' -RRB- which may be written down like the Bible or told from memory like the Dreamtime stories of Australian Aboriginal people .
In many religions there are people who take the role of `` priest '' and spend their lives teaching others about the religion .
There are also people who take the role of `` pastor '' and spend their life caring for other people .
A person may be both a priest and a pastor .
They are called by different names in different religions .
Symbols are used to remind people of their religious beliefs .
They are also used or worn as a sign to other people that the person belongs to a particular religion .
A symbol might be something that is drawn or written , it might be a piece of clothing or jewellery , it might be a sign that a person makes with their body , or it might be a building or monument or artwork .
Picture symbols for different religions are shown in the box in the introduction to this article .
In many religions it is thought important that people should show other people that they are following a particular religion .
This might be done in a general way by wearing a symbol or a type of clothing .
Many people believe that it is important to tell other people about their religion , so that they can believe as well .
This is called `` witnessing '' .
There are many ways to witness .
A young person might simply say to their friends `` I do not use drugs or get drunk because of my religion '' .
This is a witness .
A person may tell their classmates , workmates and friends about their beliefs .
A person might go to other people 's houses and talk about their beliefs , or invite the people to join in the rituals of the religion , such as going to church or to a religious festival .
A person might have printed material such as books or leaflets that they give to other people to read .
A person might travel to a different country to teach , to work in a health service or to help people in some other way .
-LRB- People who do this are called `` missionaries '' . -RRB-
These are different ways that people witness to their religion .
When a person hears a witness and decides that they will join the religion , this is called a `` conversion '' .
Usually a person decides to join a religion because they like what they have read or been told , and they believe that they are hearing the truth .
They join the religion because they choose .
However , throughout history there have been many times when people have been forced to join a religion by violence and threats .
This is still happening today .
In most countries of the world people are free to belong to whatever religion they choose .
This is generally thought of as a basic human right .
However , there are parts of the world where it is illegal -LRB- against the law -RRB- to witness to any religion except the one accepted by the government of the country .
People who belong to other religions may be threatened , put in jail or murdered .
Rituals are an important part of the tradition of many religions .
In many religions it is the tradition for people to meet for a celebration on one day in every week .
There are also major celebrations that may be held only at certain times of the year , for example , on the birthday of a person who is honored in that religion .
Some religions have celebrations for different seasons of the year , or when the sun or moon is in a certain part of the sky .
In nearly every religion , the important stages of a person 's life have a religious celebration .
Birth , naming , reaching an age to think for oneself , reaching adulthood , marriage , childbirth , sickness and death are all celebrated by some religions .
Having a celebration or special traditions when a person dies is very common .
It is the traditions that are about death that give the earliest evidence of religious beliefs .
Scientists have discovered that 120,000 years ago Neanderthal people started burying their dead .
Early Homo sapiens put tools and other things into graves with the bodies , as if they could use them in the afterlife .
From 40,000 years ago , many of the objects in graves are small artworks .
Scientists believe that these objects were put there for religious reasons .
An institution is one name for an organization .
Many religions have organizations that manage the way that people who follow the religion are to act .
The organization might employ religious leaders , educate people into the ideas of the religion , manage money , own buildings and make rules .
The organization might be worldwide , like the Roman Catholic Church , or it might be just a small group of people like the Tempe Bible Tract Society .
Most religions have special buildings where people meet .
They are often called temples .
In Judaism they are called synagogues .
In Christianity they are called churches .
In Islam they are called mosques .
People often try to make their religious building as beautiful as possible .
Some religious buildings are great works of architecture .
People often make artworks that are about their religion , or that are used in religious celebration , or are put in a religious building .
Religious art comes in all shapes and sizes , from tiny pieces of jewellery to huge statues and paintings .
Artworks often give important clues to historians about different ancient religions that are not well understood .
Music is often important in religious celebrations .
Singing , chanting and playing musical instruments are often part of regular religious gatherings of people .
Special music is often used on special occasions .
Many famous composers have written religious music .
The words of songs that are 3,000 years old are used every day in Christian churches and Jewish synagogues .
Joseph Rudyard Kipling -LRB- 30 December 1865-18 January 1936 -RRB- was an English author and poet .
He wrote the children 's book The Jungle Book .
He also wrote the well-known poems , If â '' and Gunga Din .
Kipling is buried in Westminster Abbey .
Recreation or fun is a person 's time of refreshing his or her body and mind .
There are many different forms of recreation which are shaped by individual interests and by environment ; a few examples being reading , playing or listening to music , watching movies or TV , gardening , hunting , hobbies , sports , studies , and travel .
Public places such as parks and beaches are very important for many recreational activities .
Tourism profession has recognized long ago that many of their clients are specifically attracted by recreational offerings .
Red is the color that is on the outside edge of the rainbow .
It is one of the three primary colors , along with blue and yellow .
Red light has a wavelength between 630-750 nanometers .
Red is the color of some apples .
Red is the color of some blood and the occasional tomato .
It is sometimes used to mark things that are wrong , important , or dangerous .
red is also the meaning of strong deseperation for love or to be in a relationship .

Foods are raw when they are not cooked .
Most things are good to eat raw , but some , such as eggplants , can be poisonous .
There 's currently no solid evidence to suggest that raw food is more healthy than cooked food .
Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of bacteria which would otherwise be destroyed by cooking .
The Roman Empire was the largest empire of the ancient world .
Its capital was Rome , and its empire was based on the Mediterranean .
The Empire dates from 27 BC , when Octavian became the Emperor Augustus .
The empire was the third stage of Ancient Rome .
Rome was first ruled by kings , then by the Roman Republic , then by an emperor .
Many modern lands were once part of the Roman Empire , including Britain -LRB- not Scotland -RRB- , Spain , Portugal , France , Italy , Greece , Turkey , Germany , Egypt , and the north coast of Africa .
The language of the Roman Empire was Latin .
The western part of the Roman Empire continued for almost 1000 years , and the eastern part , including Greece and Turkey , continued for about a thousand years more .
The eastern part was called the Byzantine Empire with a capital at Constantinople .
In order to control their large empire , the Romans developed important ideas about law and government .
They developed the best army in the world at that time , and ruled by force .
They had fine engineering , and built roads , cities , and outstanding buildings .
The Empire was divided into provinces , each with a provincial governor plus civil and military support .
Letters would constantly go to and from Rome , both official and private letters .
Trade was most important for Rome , a city of a million people , by far the largest city in the world .
They needed , and got , wheat from Egypt , tin from Britannia , grapes from Gaul , and so on .
In return , the Roman built provincial capitals into fine cities , protected them from raids by barbarians , and provided education and career opportunites for young people in the provinces , offered careers in the Roman army .
In principle , emperors had absolute control , and could do as they pleased .
In practice , they faced many difficult problems .
They had a staff of what we call ` civil servants ' and the advice of the Roman Senate .
The emperor had to decide what were the most important issues facing the Empire , and what should be done about them .
Most of them tried to do two sorts of thing .
One was to do things to improve the life of Romans in peacetime .
The other was to fight and defeat Rome 's enemies .
A wealthy empire always has enemies .
With kings and emperors , a big problem is the succession .
Who follows them when they die ?
Sometimes it would be his eldest son , if he was capable of ruling .
More often it would be an adopted son .
It worked like this .
The emperor would notice an outstanding young man from one of the best families .
He would adopt him as his son .
Before he died he would make clear whom he thought should succeed him , by making him a Roman consul , or by stating in his will that the younger man should succeed him .
Sometimes this worked ; sometimes it did not .
Every now and then there would be a civil war between claimants to the throne .
An adopted son or two gave the emperor more choices .
Some emperors had no son ; some had sons who were killed in battle , or died during a plague .
Later on , emperors grew so weak that the military would just pick one of their generals to be the next emperor .
This often led to civil war .
The life stories of the emperors can be found in List of Roman emperors .
The Romans fought many wars against other countries , and enjoyed watching violent sports .
They enjoyed watching races between chariots pulled by horses , and fights between men using weapons -LRB- gladiators -RRB- .
Unlike in modern sports , the fighters were often killed in these fights .
Romans enjoyed these shows in the Roman Colosseum .
The Romans built many large public buildings and villas , aqueducts to carry water , and good stone bridges and roads .
Some of these things can still be seen today .
Many famous writers were Romans , including Cicero and Virgil .
The New Testament of the Bible tells about the Romans in the life of Jesus Christ .
During Jesus ' life , the Romans , who were pagan , controlled his country .
Later , several emperors tried to destroy Christianity but they did not succeed .
By 312 AD the emperor Galerius allowed people freedom to follow Christianity , and the next year , a general , Constantine , became emperor and converted to Christianity .
The city of Rome was taken over several times by barbarians , notably in 410 AD when the Goths sacked the city -LRB- stole the goods -RRB- .
The last Western Roman emperor , Romulus Augustus , resigned in 476 AD .
The Roman Empire would last another 1,000 years as the Byzantine Empire in the east .
A regime is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state .
There are many kinds of regimes .
They can achieve power in many ways .
Depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system , they can lose power in many ways too .
The most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup , invasion or revolution until the 20th century .
After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods .
Peaceful regime change is usually by an election - this method is now used by more than half the people on the Earth .
It is called representative democracy .
Such regimes are often called administrations to make it clear they are not dictators , and since the executive branch does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a legislative branch .
Also the judicial branch is separate .
The courts are not usually considered part of the regime .
When many regimes negotiate at the United Nations or World Trade Organization , it does not matter at all how each regime got its power .
It matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says .
When someone wants a regime to change in another country , they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its election .
This is common if a regime is threatened by another regime .
A river is a stream of water that flows through a `` channel '' -LRB- or passage -RRB- in the surface of the ground .
The passage where the river flows is called the riverbed and the earth on each side is called a riverbank .
A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground , because of gravity .
A river begins as a small stream and gets bigger , the farther that it flows .
The water in a river is called `` fresh water '' .
It comes from rain or snow and it can usually be drunk safely , unless it has been polluted .
The water in a sea can not be drunk safely because it is `` salt water '' .
Both people and animals often live near rivers , because they need water to survive .
The start of a river is called its `` source '' or its `` headwaters '' .
The part of the river that is near the source is called a `` young '' or `` youthful river '' .
A young river is often in a V-shaped river bed , and flows quickly downhill over stones , and around big rocks .
Young rivers often have lots of small waterfalls and rapids .
The middle part of a river is called a `` mature river '' .
A mature river makes a riverbed that is U-shaped .
It might be very deep and run fast .
It sweeps over small rocks and boulders , and makes big turns around hills and mountains .
It is much wider than a `` young river '' , but not as wide as an `` old river '' .
To cross over a mature river , people use bridges .
Many cities and towns are built on the banks of mature rivers .
Many farms that keep animals such as dairy cows , horses and sheep are found along mature rivers because the animals can drink from the river every day .
A river usually ends by flowing into an ocean , a lake or a bigger river .
The place where the river flows out into a bigger body of water is called the `` mouth '' of the river .
As a river flows towards its mouth , the countryside around the river often changes from hilly to flat .
As it flows over the flat land the river becomes wider and slower .
A wide slow river is called an `` old river '' .
An `` old river '' often floods across the land after there is lots of rain at the `` headwaters '' .
An `` old river '' slowly builds up its banks on either side ; the high banks are called `` levees '' .
An old river often `` meanders '' -LRB- twists and turns -RRB- , and sometimes , after a flood , it leaves lakes behind which are called `` ox-bows '' or `` billabongs '' .
Old rivers are the most useful type of river for growing crops .
Corn , rice , fruit , cotton , hay , tobacco and sugar are some of the crops that are grown near old rivers .
The shape of the mouth depends on the conditions of the sea where it flows .
If there is a strong tide where the river meets the sea , the river forms an estuary .
An estuary is a wide , funnel-like mouth of the river .
The fresh water of the river mixes slowly with the salt water , becoming brackish water â `` a `` break '' between fresh and salty water .
Many kinds of fish , clams , mollusks and other sealife live at estuaries .
Many of the world 's largest cities and harbors are located at estuaries .
Where a river flows out to the sea , it sometimes flows very slowly through sandy or muddy land , making lots of little islands as it flows .
The main stream of the river gets broken into many parts that spread out into a triangle shape like the Greek letter `` Delta '' .
When this happens , it is called the `` delta '' of the river .
Deltas are often places that are not good for towns or farms but are very good for birds and other wildlife and fishing .
Deltas are often made into wildlife reserves .
Not all rivers have deltas .
There are famous deltas on the Nile River , the Amazon River , the Mekong River , the Mississippi River and the Danube River .
Some rivers flow underground through caves .
Underground rivers form in places where there are lots of cracks in the rocks above , so that in rainy weather , the water runs downs and collects in small underground streams .
Sometimes the underground water trickles or gushes out of the ground to form a small `` spring '' of water .
In other places , where there are caves , the small underground streams run together to form a river .
The river can sometimes run through deep wide underground caverns .
While many underground rivers flow gently , some underground rivers flow fast and have rapids , particularly after heavy rain .
Many underground rivers flow out through a cave mouth to become an ordinary river .
The water in rivers is `` fresh water '' that has come from rain , snow and from underground streams .
It can usually be drunk safely by people unless it is too dirty because of mud or human pollution .
People and animals need fresh water to drink , so they often live by the side of a river .
A right angle is an angle with a measurement of 90 degrees .
When two lines cross each other so that all the angles have the same size , the result is four right angles .
The top of the letter T is at right angles to the vertical line .
Walls of buildings are usually at right angles to the floor .
Two things that are at right angles are called `` perpendicular '' .
A ranch is a large farm where animals such as cows , horses or sheep are raised .
A ranch is often on private land .
The word ranch is from the Spanish word `` rancho '' .
Ranches are often found in the desert regions of Australia or the American west because there is plenty of available space .
A sport utility vehicle -LRB- SUV -RRB- is a type of vehicle that can carry lots of passengers , like a station wagon or minivan .
SUVs are shaped like a big station wagon .
However , they are taller , because the seats are more upright and because they have a taller suspension so that they can go off road .
-LRB- However , less than 10 percent of these vehicles actually do go off road . -RRB-
Another way that many SUVs are different from some regular cars is that many SUVs have four-wheel-drive , but most regular cars only have two-wheel-drive .
Also , many SUVs have larger engines , like a six - or an eight-cylinder engine , .
In some countries , SUVs often have diesel engines .
SUVs come from designs that were originally military or commercial , such as the Jeep and the Land Rover .
These vehicles have been popular for many years with rural people because they can go off-road , but now they are also popular with people in urban areas because they believe that they look good .
Consequently , newer SUVs are more like cars because buyers like it that way .
Instead of buying a car they buy a SUV that 's designed like a car .
They have luxury features and more car-like suspensions and ride heights .
This is because most of these newer SUVs seldom go off-road , but stay on the street most of the time .
However , some people do take their SUVs off the road to explore places that they could not go with a car , and to enjoy the driving .
Because of this , there are many off-road clubs in different countries .
SUVs are even raced , such as in the Paris-Dakar Rally and the Australian Safari .
Also , there are many fun things you can do with a SUV .
For example , you can tow a boat with an SUV .
There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular .
One reason is the comfort of their large cabins -- they can carry almost as much as a minivan .
Another reason is that people think they are safe .
Finally , a major reason why they are popular is that they have a rugged , powerful image .
People buy them because they look good , even though a small car might be less expensive and more practical .
Automobile companies have sold many SUVs .
They make more profit on them per vehicle than with other automobiles , because they are cheaper and simpler to build than many passenger cars of equivalent price .
Many people have bought SUVs , but now many people do not like them anymore , because SUVs are bad for the environment and dangerous to other drivers .
In addition , these people think that the SUVs are not really as safe as people believe they are .
One problem with SUVs is that they roll over more easily than lower vehicles .
In recent years Consumer Reports magazine found several SUVs unacceptable because they roll over too easily .
Also , they are big and stiff , and they have high bumpers , so when they hit another car , the other car and its passengers can be severely damaged .
Big , heavy SUVs like Ford Excursions and Chevrolet Suburbans can damage cars badly when they hit them .
SUVs have become so popular in the United States that the U.S. is using much more gasoline than before .
SUVs are much less fuel-efficient than cars .
The main reason is that the U.S. government classifies them as small trucks , so they do not have to be as fuel efficient as passenger cars .
Since auto companies have little reason to change SUVs , they are fuel-inefficient .
They are big and heavy , have a lot of wind resistance , and have big engines and a heavy suspension .
They also use tires that are better for off road than for driving on the street .
Smaller SUVs that look like cars may be shorter and use better tires , but they still have big , fuel-inefficient , polluting engines .
In Australia and Europe SUVs are usually called 4 wheel drives -LRB- 4X4 -RRB- or 4WDs .
A symbol is a drawing , shape , or object that represents an idea , object , or amount of something .
The most common symbols are letters , which are symbols of words and sounds .
A symbol can be an actual object , such as the cross -LRB- a symbol of Christianity -RRB- and the scepter -LRB- which symbolizes royalty and power -RRB- .
Symbols can even be colors or patterns .
Symbols are used often in poetry and other types of literature , most often used as metaphors or similes .
A national emblem is a symbol for a certain country .
There are thousands of symbols that are recognized by most people all over the world , and many more that are limited to certain regions , religions , sciences , etc. .
Some of the best known ones are listed below .
September is the ninth month of the year with 30 days .
From the Latin word sept for `` seven '' -LRB- it was the seventh month of the year , before January and February were added to the beginning of the year . -RRB-
September begins on the same day of week as December every year .
In Ancient Greece , September was called Boedromion .
September 's flower is the Aster with the birthstone being the sapphire .
The meaning of the sapphire is love .
Sound can also mean a body of water , like a bay or channel .
We can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium .
Sound is the term to describe what is heard when sound waves pass through a medium to the ear .
All sounds are made by vibrations .
For instance , when a drum or a cymbal is struck , the object vibrates .
These vibrations make air molecules move .
Sound waves move away from their source -LRB- where they came from -RRB- , traveling on the air molecules .
When the vibrating air molecules reach our ears , the eardrum vibrates , too .
The bones of the ear vibrate in the same way that of the object that started the sound wave .
These vibrations let you hear different sounds .
Even music is a vibration .
Irregular vibrations are noise .
Sound waves have two parts : compression and rarefaction .
Compression is the part of the sound waves where the molecules of air are pushed -LRB- compressed -RRB- together .
Rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other .
Sound waves are a lot of compressions and rarefactions .
Sound waves can travel through solids , liquids , and gases , but it can not travel through a vacuum -LRB- a place with nothing in it -RRB- .
This is why astronauts can not talk to each other in space : they need a radio to hear each other .
Sound can travel through water faster than through air ; and they travel even faster in solids like stone , iron , and steel .
Sound travels 1,100 feet per second in the air .
Pitch is the highness or lowness of sound .
Pitch is how humans hear different frequencies .
Frequency is determined by the number of vibrations per second .
The highest key on a piano , for instance , vibrates 4,000 times per second .
It has a frequency of 4000 hertz -LRB- Hz -RRB- , or 4 kilohertz -LRB- kHz -RRB- .
Lower keys have lower frequencies .
A note an octave higher than another note has twice the frequency of that note .
The intensity of a sound is how much sound energy goes through a square meter in one second .
Sound waves with higher amplitude -LRB- more vibration -RRB- have higher intensity .
Also , the intensity of a sound is higher closer to the sound source .
The inverse square law shows how sound intensity gets less farther from the sound source .
This law says when distance gets multipied by a number , sound intensity gets divided by that number squared -LRB- the number times itself -RRB- .
Sound intensities can be very different .
They can range from 0.000000000001 W\/m2 -LRB- barely audible -RRB- to 1 W\/m2 -LRB- painfully loud -RRB- .
The decibel scale makes sound intensity numbers easier to work with .
A 0.000000000001 W\/m2 intensity is 0 dB -LRB- decibels -RRB- .
When the decibel number increases by 10 , the intensity is ten times as much .
So , a 1 W\/m2 intensity is 120 dB .
Loudness is how people sense the intensity of sound .
Loudness depends on sound intensity , sound frequency , and the person 's hearing .
Audible sound has frequencies between 20 Hz to 20 kHz .
Human beings can hear audible sound .
Sound waves with frequency above 20 kHz are called ultrasound waves .
Sound waves with frequency below 20 Hz are called infrasound waves .
Human beings can not hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves , but some animals , like bats and dolphins , use them .
Older people have an even smaller hearing range .
People are best at hearing sounds between 1000 Hz and 6000 Hz .
When a sound source is moving towards someone , the frequency seems to increase .
The same thing happens when someone moves toward the sound source .
Frequency seems to decrease when someone moves away from a sound source .
It also seems to decrease when the sound source moves away from someone .
This is the Doppler Effect .
Society is the term to describe human beings together -LRB- collective , the sum of their social networks and power networks -RRB- .
It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does , but only to those things that everybody acts upon - or refuses to do - quite reliably .
Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest , a society is very concerned with its citizenship , rights , ethics and time limits .
These are basic ways to achieve fairness .
If they break down badly , people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other , refusing to help each other , or seeing those who have more as cheats .
While every society is different , the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same : fraud , theft , violence , war and sometimes even genocide if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a `` race '' of people .
A new society may be formed out of only those who still agree , or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one .
If the strength and unity of any society 's members ' willingness to help each other is to be measured , it is called social capital , because it substitutes for other styles of capital .
One needs less money with more solidarity in society , because the collective substitutes for the currency .
However , usually , the strength is not directly measured , but only assumed .
People take risks that society will support them , without knowing for sure that it will .
For instance , they may refuse to obey the law , and count on their fellow society members to free them in a jury or court of appeal .
A social contract sets out rules for this kind of cooperation .
One kind of social contract is a constitution - which allows for a jury or court to decide that the law , not the person , is wrong , according to the society 's rules .
A suggestion is an idea that one suggests , or says is good for another -LRB- or others -RRB- to follow .
Some people may agree to it , and some may disagree .
If they disagree or have a different suggestion , the person who first suggested the idea will usually discuss with the other people and find a good conclusion that satisfies both and is good .
Spache Readability Formula is one method of finding out how hard a piece of writing is -LRB- its textual difficulty -RRB- .
The method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing .
The words that are not on the list are called unfamiliar .
The number of words per sentence are counted .
This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula .
The result is a reading age .
Someone of this age should be able to read the text .
Spache works best on texts that are for children under the age of eight .
the formula ; -LRB- 0.141 \* average sentence length -RRB- + -LRB- 0.086 \* percentage of difficult words -RRB- +0.839 = grade level
GL = -LRB- .121 \* ASL -RRB- + -LRB- .082 \* UW -RRB- + .659
GL = U.S. grade level ASL = Average sentence length UW = Number of unique unfamiliar words
A sport is commonly defined as a sort of game that requires physical activity and involves a degree of competition as , for example , baseball , soccer , bowling , or basketball .
Many adolescents and adults play sports with their friends .
Sportsmans need coaches to teach or train teams or individuals how to do better .
Sports can be played indoors or outdoors .
Some people like to watch other people play sports .
Those who like to watch people playing sports are called fans .
While some fans watch sports on television , others actually go to places where people play sports to watch them in person .
These fans are called spectators .
Today , research uses the scientific method .
Scientific research is used to increase knowledge by creating theories based on previous knowledge , and then testing those theories using experiments .
The word science can also refer to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process , so far .
People who do science are called scientists .
Scientists study things by looking at them very carefully , by measuring them , and by doing experiments and tests .
Scientists try to explain why things act the way they do , and are the way they are .
The `` scientific method '' is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge .
Most people accept the scientific method as the most reliable way to get knowledge about nature , the universe , and the human body .
Alhazen took many years to prove his claim , that `` light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only '' .
At the end , he demonstrated his claim by placing a a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam .
Not everyone agrees about how science works exactly .
Some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted as long as they are the best explanation for the data that exists , and when theories no longer explain the data , they are discarded and replaced .
Other people say that sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it , or that they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually .
Science is a way to get knowledge by discarding what is not true .
Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure .
They compete to provide better explanations .
An explanation might be interesting or pleasing , but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure , they will try to find a better explanation .
Before a scientific article is published , other scientists read the article and decide whether the explanations make sense from the data .
This is called peer review .
After articles are published , other scientists will also check if the same experiments , observations or tests produce the same data again .
Peer review and repeating experiments are the only way to be sure the knowledge is correct .
Science makes models of nature , models of our universe , and medicine .
There are many different sciences with their own names .
However it is not right to say `` science says '' any one thing .
Science is a process , not just the facts and rules believed at one time .
The Saint Lawrence River is a big river in eastern North America .
It flows between the Canadian province of Ontario and the American state of New York , and through the Canadian province of Quebec .
The river drains water from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean .
It is more than three thousand kilometres long .
The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big `` estuary '' or bay , the biggest in the world ; this is called the Gulf of Saint Lawrence .
The Canadian cities of Kingston , Montreal , and Quebec City are on this river .
It is very important because ships can sail up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America .
It is the third largest river in Canada .
Seville -LRB- spelled Sevilla in Spanish -RRB- is a big city in the South of Spain , in Europe .
There is a big river called the Guadalquivir River which goes through Seville .
The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish region called Andalusia and of the province of Sevilla .
The people who live in the city are called Sevillanos and there are almost a million of them : 700,000 .
A very old story says that the city was started by the famous hero of Greece , named Hercules .
The Romans when they came to Spain gave it the Latin name of Hispalis .
Over time this changed to be spelled in English as Seville .
The Arab Moors took the city when they invaded the country , and you can still see a lot of the buildings they built during their 800 year stay in Spain -LRB- 711-1492 -RRB- .
In the year 1992 Seville was the place for the Expo 92 .
There is a beautiful bridge across the Guadalquivir River called Puente del Alamillo .
It was thought up by Santiago Calatrava a famous building expert .
Seville is famous for its hot summer weather .
Seville is the home town of two soccer teams , Sevilla FC -LRB- often called simply `` El Sevilla '' -RRB- and Real Betis BalompiÃ -LRB- often called `` El Betis '' -RRB- .
Seville is also the name of a place in the State of Ohio .
Salami is a sausage that first came from Italy .
The name comes from the Italian salare meaning to make something salty .
The original salami was made from a mix of chopped pork and salt which was dried using air in a casing .
People who are Muslim are not allowed to eat this type of salami because it is pork .
Now there are many types of salamis made in some countries .
Nearly all are seasoned with a combination of herbs and spices in addition to salt .
Salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying .
Some kinds are made of beef while others mix beef and pork .
Most , if not all Italian salamis have garlic in them , but few German kinds do .
Some , like a few salamis from Spain , include paprika or chili .
The difference between some types is in how coarse or fine the meat is chopped .
Some `` light '' salami might add turkey or chicken to reduce both fat and calories .
Many salamis are named after the city or region where they come from .
Some examples are Arles , Genoese , Hungarian , and Milano salamis .
Special English is a simple form of the English language .
It is used by a public radio station called Voice of America , run by the United States government in Special English programs every day .
Its news and feature programs are read more slowly than usual , using fewer English words and simple grammar .
The contents of Simple English programs are much easier to understand .
Simple English is clearer and simpler , and it uses shorter sentences .
It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English .
In some countries , for example China , Special English is popular among people learning English .
Special English was first used on October 19 , 1959 .
Sausage is a food made of ground-up or chopped-up meat .
It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing .
Other meats , like the hot dog , pepperoni , bologna , and salami also are covered with a casing like a sausage 's .
Sausages often have meat from the animal 's head , lips , cheeks , and other parts .
Some have blood in them .
Irish and English sausages normally have a lot of `` rusk , '' or bread crumbs , and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries .
Sausages may be used as a meal , in a sandwich , or in other foods like stews .
Many countries and regions have special kinds of sausage .
Sausages are some of the oldest foods .
Slang is words that are informal .
Usually each generation or social group has its own slang - for example , older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people .
On the other hand , younger people often understand , but find silly or old-fashioned , the slang of older people .
Over time , language tends to get more complex , since new words enter much faster than old words leave .
Over time , slang almost always becomes part of the language , and approved for use by all .
It has also happened that some words used in Anglo-Saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by Latinate words like `` urinate '' , `` defecate '' and `` copulate '' - which polite people were supposed to use after the Norman invasion of England in 1066 .
This was in part a way of making poor people -LRB- who spoke Anglo-Saxon -RRB- all appear to be rude , while more powerful people -LRB- who spoke Norman -RRB- appeared to be polite - one way that etiquette can develop , and reinforce power structure .
This is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one group 's language as ` slang ' and another as ` correct ' .
Wanting to have rules of grammar that do not change and the same vocabulary used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group 's language as correct .
An `` idiom '' can be slang , but it can also be a metaphor that becomes part of the culture .
Welcome to the Simple English Wikipedia , an easy-to-read online encyclopedia for people who are learning English .
The Simple English Wikipedia 's articles can be used to help with school homework or just for the fun of learning about new ideas .
Non-English Wikipedias can also translate from the articles here .
Articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use fewer words and easier grammar than the ordinary English Wikipedia .
The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs , such as students , children , adults with learning difficulties and people who are trying to learn English .
Other people may use the Simple English Wikipedia because simple language helps them to understand unfamiliar topics or complex ideas .
When the Simple English Wikipedia began , the ordinary English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles , and seven other Wikipedias in other languages had over 15,000 articles .
Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles , most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple ; they are usually not new articles .
This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia .
If someone can not understand an idea in complex English , they can read the Simple English article .
For this reason , people writing Simple English articles should put in `` interwiki links '' to and from the other Wikipedias .
Also , it is good to always look at all versions in all languages , to get new ideas .
`` What Wikipedia is not '' has a good list of things which we are not doing .
These things are a little different from the things the ordinary English Wikipedia does not do .
For example , in the Simple English version it is more important to explain slang , idiom , and jargon .
The Simple English Wikipedia also has some articles that are also in the Wiktionary .
Anyone can write in the Simple English Wikipedia , including high school students , people with learning disabilities , and people who are learning English .
Simple English writers are very mixed , more so than at English Wikipedia , or at other Wikipedias .
It is important to respect the different types of people who are writing articles in the Simple English Wikipedia , and to be friendly with people who have trouble speaking English .
Remember that Wikipedia is a service which many communities use .
If you wish to write articles for the Simple English Wikipedia , read How to write Simple English articles .
See Wikipedia for a simple English introduction to the project in all languages , and Useful for a list of pages that can help you more .
You can ask questions at Simple talk .
Simple English is similar to English , but it only uses basic words .
We suggest that articles should use only the 1,000 most common and basic words in English .
They should also use only simple grammar and shorter sentences .
Writers can also use a special system , for example , Basic English .
Of course , people can write original articles ; these could be put in both this and the main Wikipedia -LRB- with a normal level of English -RRB- .
Usually , only about 2,000 words are enough to write a normal article .
Since some articles need more than 2,000 different words , some complex articles use more words .
But even very basic concepts -LRB- zero , one , two -RRB- are too difficult to explain with a small number of words .
For detailed writing about science , politics , or religion , articles sometimes need more words , but the English must be simple .
Sometimes , an article uses more than 2,000 words , or , at most , 3,000 , but it explains all the difficult words .
Articles need some complex words because of the article names in the ordinary English Wikipedia , and to use normal words would make the article too simple .
Articles on scientific topics -LRB- like Earth -RRB- usually need complex words .
There are no rules about vocabulary , tense or suffixes .
Some articles use only Basic English -LRB- 850 words -RRB- , but this wiki has no strong rules about which words can be used , as E Prime does .
If a word is not simple or not used often here , it should be explained on a new page .
Two times there have been proposals to close Simple English Wikipedia .
See : meta : Proposals for closing projects\/Closure of Simple English Wikipedia -LRB- October 2007 -RRB- and : meta : Proposals for closing projects\/Closure of Simple English Wikipedia -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- October 2008 -RRB- .
A social contract is an agreement between the people of a state and the government of a state .
The people agree to follow certain rules made by the government .
These rules are usually called laws .
Laws help to make sure people have rights and that their rights are taken care of .
One kind of social contract is a constitution .
A constitution sets limits on the powers of government leaders , police , and other people who have authority .
The first social contracts were written by philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau .
They saw good government as coming from social contracts .
Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract .
Both the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution are social contracts .
Social capital is the willingness of people to help each other .
It often replaces money which people would use to buy the same help .
Society works best when there is plenty of social capital .
The less social capital there is , the more social problems there usually are .
If there is no social capital , war and revolution often results .
People who have no money and can not get help from society may have to agree to do things they do not want to do , or force others to do things they do not want to .
Organized crime grows in this way , and so do forced labor and slavery .
Most ways of measuring social capital have to do with trust - people who trust that favors and help will be available when they need it will favor and help others more .
Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help .
A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping .
Some call this kind of person a social parasite .
They are very hard to detect , unlike people who cheat or commit fraud .
When there are too many of these kinds of people , especially when they are politicians , people begin to mistrust their government .
Rather than work with a political party to change law , they may start to look for direct revenge for things .
Social capital is a lot like real capital .
The more money a person or a society has , the easier it is to do things and the better off people are .
The less money , the more difficult things become and the worse people feel .
A site is a real fixed physical location where something will or has happened or a place where something is .
It is used very often in building trades to mean the place where a building will go up .
A gravesite is a place where a person will be buried after they die .
The words onsite and offsite refer to work that must take place on the site , or which can take place somewhere else .
For instance , a prefabricated building can be `` built offsite '' and then `` moved onsite '' .
Site is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for `` website '' .
In this case no real physical location exists other than the place where the computers are , and one `` goes to the site '' simply by using a web browser to `` go to '' that URL .
This is a conceptual metaphor .
It can be confusing .
Someone who uses it is also likely using other jargon .
Subtraction is the arithmetic operation for finding the difference between two numbers .
The special names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are , minuend subtrahend = difference .
The expression 7 4 = 3 can be spoken as `` seven minus four equals three , '' `` seven take away four leaves three , '' or `` four from seven leaves three . ''
If the minuend is less than the subtrahend , the difference will be a negative number .
For example , 17 25 = -LRB- 8 -RRB- .
We can say this as , `` Seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight . ''
This is how cash registers determine the change you receive when you pay with more money than your purchase costs .
String theory is the name for a number of mathematical models that want to find a common explanation for the four main forces that have so far been observed in nature .
These forces are gravity , the electromagnetic force , the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force , respectively .
Classical physics says that the universe is made of small particles -LRB- points -RRB- which are basically static and unchanging .
String theory says that the particle is a string\/line -LRB- not a particle\/point -RRB- that forms these four different forces by vibrating in different ways .
String Theory suggests that the universe is similar to a very big guitar .
The strings upon the guitar are one dimensional and vibrate to take the form of all matter .
Usually , scientists think of matter as being made of very , very small particles .
These particles are so small -LRB- much smaller than an atom -RRB- that we can not observe them to see their shape .
At this time , all mathematical formulas say that the particles are point-like and therefore have no shape at all .
The main idea behind string theory is that this is wrong , and that these small particles are instead shaped as tiny loops of string .
The theory imagines that these strings are not precise particles -LRB- unlike things that are seen and counted -RRB- .
The strings are very small , yet they seem to act like regular particles .
It explains how other particles and forces act .
Because they are so small their actual shape does not matter much when we are looking at larger objects .
String theory suggests that when these tiny loops move really , really fast back and forth in different and diverse ways , they are actually a different type of matter .
In other words , if the string theory loop oscillates in one way it becomes a different type of matter than if it oscillates in another way -LRB- these changes in oscillation can be hard to detect , as the `` strings '' are oscillating in at least 10 different dimensions -RRB- .
It is used as a possible way of explaining how some things work ; it is very hard for scientists to prove everything , or answer every question that they can imagine by using just one theory on its own .
String Theory is slightly different from most other theories because it could help scientists get closer to explaining everything that they can think of , so many scientists are excited by the ideas that String Theory has to offer .
It could someday be a `` Theory of Everything '' , something that scientists such as Albert Einstein had been dreaming of for a very long time .
There are two ideas that predict the same physical observations of the whole universe .
One is `` as large as we think the universe is '' , about the 74 billion light years circumference predicted in Weeks ' model .
The other is much smaller than the Planck Length .
Both mathematics are just as good to explain what we can see .
There are several different versions of string theory as well .
The Superstring theory is based on 10 or 11 dimensions .
The Bosonic string theory has 26 dimensions .
Gravity is the only real force in the theory .
It says only four of the ten dimensions can be observed by us , and that the others hint at the other forces that are observed .
It does not say that other physics theories are not true , or wrong .
String theory has led to many new ideas in the mathematics of folding , knots and Calabi-Yau spaces .
There are many different versions of string theory , and none of them are fully accurate .
Often , many of them use only good guesses .
String theory proponents say this is because the theory is not finished yet .
Another problem is that the mathematical laws of string theory also give lots of different possible solutions .
Scientists that believe in string theory work around this problem by picking only the results that match our observations and saying that later we will find why the other ones are not good .
Opponents argue that we can not ever know if a theory is true as a whole if we only take the bits that work .
This also makes the theory of little use until the issue is solved , because mathematical laws are usually used to predict what will happen in a situation - but string theory can not yet answer that question , because it needs to be tried first and then scientists can pick the answers that work .
Yet another problem is that it says our universe is made of at least 10 dimensions , while we only see four -LRB- width , height , depth , time -RRB- .
String theory proponents say some dimensions may not be visible to us , but others doubt there can be 6 or more hidden dimensions , or that we will never be able to access them even if they do exist .
String theory does not make guesses that can actually be tested by scientists today or in the near future .
Some people say this makes the theory unscientific .
A scientist is a person who works in science .
A scientist tries to understand how our world , or other things , work .
Scientists are people who make observations , ask questions and do extensive research work in finding the answers to these questions .
Scientists work for governments , companies , schools and research institutes .
Some scientists teach at universities and other places and train people to become scientists .
Scientists can work in different areas of science .
Here are some examples :
Science is the study of all things both living and non-living in the environment around us .
Scientists use experiments and tests to figure out , for example , if something is metal or not .
A soapbox is a temporary platform used to give a speech .
During the 19th century , soap was transported in wooden boxes .
When a person had new or unusual ideas , and wanted to talk to a crowd about them , sometimes he or she would stand on an empty soapbox so that everyone could see and hear the talk well .
People sometimes use the word `` soapbox '' to mean a place to say new or unusual things .
The word supernatural is used for things that some people believe are real , but that are not part of nature .
Because we can not prove whether these things are real , people often disagree about these things .
Scientists say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural , because we can not prove that supernatural things are real .
Other people say that although we can not prove supernatural things in a scientific way , they are real .
Many ideas like religion , magic , miracles , spirits , ghosts , angels , devils , gods , and God are supernatural .
In comic books , the superhero is a person with supernatural abilities and tries to hide them .
In books , a character -LRB- Usually Fantasy , or Science fiction -RRB- has some sort of supernatural powers .
For example : A witch who can cast magic .
Some types of distilled alcoholic drinks are also called spirits -LRB- as a plural , not `` spirit '' -RRB- .
In many religions , a spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body .
Other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost .
When a body is alive , it has a spirit in it .
Death is when the spirit separates from the body .
Some people think that without their bodies , spirits can still exist on the Earth and in places like Heaven or Hell .
Some believe that spirits can talk with people , or change things in the world .
Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way , but a few include this as part of their practice .
Another use of spirit means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document .
For example , the `` spirit of a law '' is the meaning of the law which the creator wanted .
This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing , but a judge must decide what meaning is correct .
A sail is a large piece of cloth on the top of some boats .
The wind goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the water .
The piece that the sail is attached to is called a mast .
Some boats have many sails , and some have only one .
Usually , small boats have only one sail , and bigger boats have more .
Boats with sails are called sailing boats .
There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails .
Before people made boats with engines that used coal or oil , sailing boats were an important way to travel across oceans .
Now they are not so important for transport , but they are still used for recreation and competition .
Skin is the outside covering of animals .
The skin of different kinds of animals is very different .
Many kinds of animals have hair or fur on their skin .
Birds have feathers on their skin .
Most fish , and reptiles like snakes and lizards , have scales on their skin .
The skin of human beings usually has very small hairs on it that are hard to see .
Some people have more hair , or hair that is easier to see , and some have less .
People have hair that is longer and easier to see on some parts of their bodies , such as the tops of their heads and men 's beards .
The skin of animals can be made into leather .
Leather is sometimes used to make shoes , bags , and balls .
Other things can be said to have `` skins '' .
People often say that fruits , such as apples and bananas , and vegetables , such as potatoes , have `` skins '' .
The Shabbat day -LRB- also known as the Sabbath Day -RRB- is the 7th day of the week in Judaism .
Usually , it is a day of rest .
This has its origins in Creation , when God made the Earth for six days , and stopped work on the seventh day .
The Shabbat day starts Friday evening when the sun goes down , until Saturday night .
According to Kabbalah , the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world in which everyone knows about God and loves Him , a kind of world that has not been since the Garden of Eden , and will not be again until the Messiah comes .
On Shabbat , work is not allowed according to the Ten Commandments .
It is a day of rest and of Torah study .
Most machines may not be used , and no work done .
Not even a light switch can be used , according to Orthodox Judaism , but not all Jewish groups do this .
It is also prohibited to cut wheat or shear sheep .
The Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Jewish Shabbat , but most Christians have it on Sunday , not Saturday .
They also rest , but not the same way as Jews .
The exact way depends on denomination .
Islam also has a Day of Rest , which also comes from Shabbat .
In Islam it is on Friday , and is called `` Yawm al-Jamme ` a , '' the `` Day of Gathering '' -LRB- For prayer -RRB- .
Statistics is a part of mathematics .
Many fields of science do tests or measurements .
Statistics is a collection , analysis , interpretation or explanation of data .
Statistics can help in two basic ways :
Statistics has been in use for a long time .
The first known statistics are census data .
The Babylonians did a census around 3500BC , the Egyptians around 2500 BC , and the Ancient Chinese around 1000 BC .
Before we can describe the world with statistics , we must collect data .
The data that we collect in statistics are called measurements .
After we collect data , we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement .
For example , suppose we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is .
We can pick a group of people -LRB- called a sample -RRB- out of the total population of viewers .
Then we ask each one how often they watch the show , or -LRB- better -RRB- we measure it by attaching an apparatus to each of their television sets .
For another example , if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure , we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after .
Most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments .
To do a survey , we pick a small number of people and ask them questions .
Then , we use their answers as the data .
The choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important , as it directly influences the statistics .
When the statistics are done , it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken .
Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake .
If we take samples next to the waste drain , we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away , hard to reach , spot of the lake .
We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample , and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly .
However , sometimes large random samples are hard to take .
And bias can happen if some people refuse to answer our questions , or if they know they are getting a fake treatment .
These problems can be hard to fix .
See also standard error .
The middle of the data is called an average .
The average tells us about a typical individual in the population .
There are three kinds of average that are often used : the mean , the median and the mode .
Where are the data and is the population size .
-LRB- see Sigma Notation -RRB- .
This means that you add up all the values , and then divide by the number of values .
The problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are distributed .
Values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot .
In statistics , these extreme values might be errors of measurement , but sometimes the population really does contain these values .
For example , if in a room there are 10 people who make $ 10\/day and 1 who makes $ 1,000,000 \/ day .
The mean of the data is $ 90,918 \/ day .
Even though it is the average amount , the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes , and is probably useless .
The median is the middle item of the data .
To find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle .
If there is an even number of data , there will not be a number right in the middle , so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean .
In our example there are 10 items of data , the two middle ones are `` 57 '' and `` 64 '' , so the median is -LRB- 57 +64 -RRB- \/ 2 = 60.5 .
Another example , like the income example presented for the mean , consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 20 , $ 40 , $ 50 , $ 60 , $ 90 , $ 90 , $ 90 , $ 100 , and $ 1,000,000 , the median is $ 55 because $ 55 is the average of the two middle numbers , $ 50 and $ 60 .
If the extreme value of $ 1,000,000 is ignored , the mean is $ 57 .
In this case , the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out .
The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of mean above .
The mode is the most frequent item of data .
For example the most common letter in English is the letter `` e '' .
We would say that `` e '' is the mode of the distribution of the letters .
For example , if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 20 , $ 40 , $ 50 , $ 60 , $ 90 , $ 90 , $ 90 , $ 100 , and $ 1,000,000 , the mode is $ 90 because $ 90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times .
There can be more than one mode .
For example , if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 20 , $ 20 , $ 50 , $ 60 , $ 90 , $ 90 , $ 90 , $ 100 , and $ 1,000,000 , the modes are $ 20 and $ 90 .
This is bi-modal , or has two modes .
Bi-modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups .
For instance , the average height of all adults in the U.S. has a bi-modal distribution .
This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1.763 m -LRB- 5 ft 9 +1 \/ 2 in -RRB- for men and 1.763 m -LRB- 5 ft 9 +1 \/ 2 in -RRB- for women .
These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined .
The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order .
Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is .
A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation .
If the standard deviation of a set of data is small , then most of the data is very close to the average .
If the standard deviation is large , though , then a lot of the data is very different from the average .
If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution , then it is very useful to know the standard deviation .
If the data follows this pattern -LRB- we would say the data is normally distributed -RRB- , about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation .
Not only that , but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation , and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average than three standard deviations .
We also can use statistics to find out that some percent , percentile , number , or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category .
For example , social scientists used statistics to find out that 49 % of people in the world are males .
Speed is the distance that an object moves in a certain amount of time .
Speed is a measure of how fast something is moving .
The average speed of an object in a certain time is the distance the object traveled divided by the time .
Speed is a scalar .
where is the distance and is the time that has gone by .
There are many units of measurement for speed .
For example , an object 's speed can be measured in
When an object changes speed , it gets faster or slower .
If the speed of the object increases , it is called acceleration .
If the object gets slower , and the speed decreases , it is called deceleration , or negative acceleration .
A server log records what is happening on a server at any time .
For example , an HTTP server runs a web site .
In modern politics , a state is an association which has control over a geographic area or territory .
States are seen as having three main pieces :
There are different forms of government a state can have , for example a republic , or a monarchy .
Sometimes , states form their own countries , sometimes many states work together to form a country .
Most states also have armed forces , civil service , law and police .
The earliest states were just groups of power .
A group of farms working together or a group of factories working together could be ` states ' since people can control them and protect them .
More organized states could be the monarchies such as early Egypt under the Pharaoh .
Following this were larger more military-based states such as the Roman Empire .
The most important early states , however , were the Ancient Greek states which had freedom , writing and a democracy .
When the military-based state , the Roman Empire , fell , lots of little states were made and each was also military-based and controlled by a king .
These states did not often work together and war raged .
However , once people within the state itself started fighting -LRB- what 's called a Civil war -RRB- , the kings had to make peace and start parliaments .
Modern states soon started in the late 15th century .
The main states in Europe were :
These states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today .
They formed proper boundaries for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more , such as the Church or the nobility .
They made armies , tax systems and embassies all to help make them more powerful and stable .
Types of state can be separated into two categories : democracy and dictatorship .
However , just because a group of states are all democratic does not mean that they follow the same rules .
Iran , Pakistan , France , Germany and the United States of America are all states .
Each of them sees itself as a democracy .
Each of them however has a different idea what democracy really means .
Different states of the same ` category ' can also function differently .
For example , two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well-trained police or army while the other does not .
Therefore , the word ` state ' only tells us what type of government that state follows -LRB- democratic or dictatorship -RRB- and does not tell us about the country itself .
There are lots of sub-types of state branching off from democracy and dictatorship .
The main ones are Pluralism , Marxism and Institutionalism .
Pluralism has been very popular in the United States .
It shows the state as a neutral place for settling arguments between other states .
Pluralism tells us that all people are not equal , but still allows each group of people to tell the state what to do .
This type of state is called a polyarchy .
Also in a pluralist state , politics , the military and the economy are all united and work together .
This means that all power in the state is ` diffused ' across the people who live there .
Marxism was popular in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s .
It was started by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels .
Marxism rejects the idea that a state is there for all the people living in it , and is definitely not a neutral place for settling arguments .
The main job of a Marxist state is to protect capitalist-made profits and to help people make contracts to keep economy in the state fair .
This is a good idea , however , the person who makes the money by using production or contracts has power over the people who do not make as much money as him .
This means that the working class -LRB- the people who work in factories etc -RRB- have hardly any power but the people who own the factories have a lot of power .
Basically , instead of giving power to everyone such as a polyarchy would do , only a small part of the people have power .
Both Marxism and Pluralism states have to react to the activities of groups of people in the state itself .
Institutionalist states do not see themselves as ` instruments ' to be controlled , they are more just geographical areas .
In this area , the people just form groups themselves .
An Institutionalist state can be made up of both Marxist and Pluralist people , both which have the power to control themselves and not influence the other parties of the state .
Anarchism is when a group of people have complete freedom and do not believe in having a state at all .
Anarchists are a lot like Marxists , since they do not believe that all people are equal , but they believe -LRB- opposite to Marxists -RRB- that a country can work without any organizations in it .
Law and order are not necessary .
Anarchists -LRB- such as Bakunin and Kropotkin in the 19th century -RRB- , often want a form of Marxism but ignoring some of their rules .
They want workers to manage themselves and simply get paid for what they do , rather than getting paid in wages .
A stream is a natural flow of water moving across country between banks .
It is smaller than a river .
The Solar System is the astronomical name for the Sun and other objects such as the planets which are bound to it by gravity .
The main component of the Solar System is the Sun , which contains 98.6 percent of the system 's mass and whose gravity holds everything else in orbit .
All the main objects in the Solar System formed at the same time , as part of the same process -LRB- see Age of the Earth -RRB- .
The formation and evolution of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 4.568 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud .
Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center , forming the Sun , while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets , moons , asteroids , and other small Solar System bodies formed .
This widely accepted model , known as the nebular hypothesis , was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg , Immanuel Kant , and Pierre-Simon Laplace .
Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy , physics , geology , and planetary science .
Since the dawn of the ` space age ' in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s , the models have been adjusted to account for new observations .
The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation .
Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets , while other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets .
Still others , as the Earth 's Moon , may be the result of giant collisions .
Collisions between bodies have occurred continually , and have been important to the evolution of the Solar System .
The positions of the planets often shifted , and planets have switched places .
This planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System 's early evolution .
The Earth 's orbit around the Sun is nearly a perfect circle , but when mapped it is found that the Earth moves around the Sun in a very slightly oval shaped , or elliptical orbit .
The other planets in the Solar System also circle the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits .
Mercury has a more elliptical orbit than the others , and some of the smaller objects orbit the Sun in very eccentric orbits .
For thousands of years , most people did not believe that the Solar System was real .
They thought that the Earth stayed still at the center of the universe .
Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos suggested that there was a special order in the sky , Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematical system .
In the 17th-century , Galileo Galilei , Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton began helping people understand physics more clearly .
This made people slowly accept the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets have the same physical laws that control Earth .
More recently , telescopes and spacecrafts have led to discoveries of mountains and craters , and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds , dust storms and ice caps on the other planets .
The planets are the biggest objects that go around Sun .
It took people many years of looking carefully through telescopes to find the farthest away ones .
No one expects to find new planets , but more small objects are found every year .
Most of the planets have moons that orbit around them .
There are at least 173 of these moons in the solar system .
Pluto had been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930 , but in 2006 astronomers meeting at the International Astronomical Union decided for the first time on the definition of a planet , and Pluto did not fit .
Instead they defined a new category of dwarf planet , into which Pluto did fit , along with some others .
Astronomers think they will find more dwarf planets soon .
There are a few main parts of the Solar System .
Here they are in order from the Sun , with the planets numbered , and the dwarf planets marked with the letters a - e.
Sometimes people use alternative names for similar regions defined above .
These are less formal , and less well defined .
Sometimes the Outer solar system is taken to mean and the Gas Giant Planets , the Kuiper Belt , and the Scattered Disk .
But with more recent discoveries of objects in the Kuiper Belt , and the Scattered Disk , and with more dwarf planet discoveries , the Outer solar system is now usually defined as above .
The Oort cloud is separate from the Trans-Neptune region , and much farther out .
The plane of the ecliptic is defined by the Earth 's orbit around the Sun .
All of the planets orbit the Sun roughly around this plane .
The farther away from this plane a planet orbits , the more inclined is its orbit .
If you could look at the solar system `` edge on '' then all the planets would be roughly in a horizontal plane around a center line of the Sun , but not around the Sun 's equator .
Slavery -LRB- also called thralldom -RRB- is an economic system .
In it , some people must work for no pay .
These people are called slaves .
There is evidence that even before there was writing , there was slavery .
There have been different types of slavery , and they have been in almost all cultures and continents .
Some societies had laws about slavery , or they had an economy that was built on it .
As of 2011 , slavery has been made against the law in almost all countries .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that slavery is wrong .
Nevertheless , there are still different forms of slavery in some countries .
The English word `` slave '' comes from the medieval word for Slavic people of Central and Eastern Europe , because these were the last ethnic group to be captured and enslaved in Central Europe .
According to Adam Smith and Auguste Comte , a slave was mainly defined as a captive or prisoner of war .
Slaves may not have all rights .
People are still being made slaves in some parts of the world .
The ways in which it is done have changed .
Today , slaves may work because of things like a high debt -LRB- for example , slaves have to work to pay off a debt -RRB- .
For girls and women , forced prostitution is a type of slavery .
Another form of slavery still happening today is forced child labor .
Some children have to work in mines or in plantations , or they have to fight wars as child soldiers , for no pay .
One study says that there are 27 million people -LRB- but others say there could be as many as 200 million -RRB- in slavery today .
Some of the countries where there is still slavery are in Africa , the Middle East , and South Asia .
In summer 2007 , 570 people were found to be slaves for brick makers in China .
Of those freed , 69 were children .
The Chinese government made a force of 35,000 police check northern Chinese brick kilns for slaves , and sent lots of kiln supervisors and officials to prison and sentenced one kiln foreman to death for killing a worker who was a slave .
In Mauritania , it is thought that up to 600,000 men , women and children , or 20 % of the population , are slaves , and that many of them are used as bonded labor .
Slavery in Mauritania was made illegal in August 2007 .
In Niger , there is also much slavery .
A Nigerian study has found that more than 800,000 people are slaves , almost 8 % of the population .
Child slavery has commonly been used when making cash crops and mining .
According to the U.S. Department of State , more than 109,000 children were working on cocoa farms alone in CÃ te d'Ivoire -LRB- Ivory Coast -RRB- in ` the worst forms of child labor ' in 2002 .
They start at about US$ 40 , in Mali , for young adult male workers .
A young woman or a girl may sell for as much as US$ 1,000 in Thailand .
In 1850 in the United States , a slave could have been US$ 1,000 â '' about $ 25,800 today .
In November 2006 , the International Labor Organisation said that it would prosecute members of the junta that rules Myanmar -LRB- also called Burma -RRB- at the International Court of Justice for `` Crimes against Humanity '' .
This is because the military makes some citizens do forced labor .
The International Labor Organisation says that it thinks that about 800,000 people are forced to work this way .
In 1833 , Britain stopped slavery , then in late 1865 the United States did the same , making it illegal .
They made it a crime to own slaves .
In the United States , it stopped after the American Civil War .
When the North won , all slaves were made free .
When that happened , it was called `` abolition of slavery '' .
Many philosophies and religions say that a soul is the part of a living human being which is supernatural and lives after death .
It can not be discovered by science , because it can not be tested in any controlled way .
Many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal experience after death .
Most atheists say that there is no such thing as a soul , and that the body is the only part of a person .
In popular culture , soul usually means deep feeling and commitment .
It is in this sense that the word appears in the term soul music .
However that music was also influenced by gospel music which was religious .
One common idea C. S. Lewis had about souls that is easy to express , is that a person is a soul , and has a body .
The soul is the `` I '' in `` I exist '' that feels and lives life .
What people call the mind could be part of the soul : one soul started this article , other souls have edited it , and another soul is reading it .
This view , however , implies that the human body is a possession , and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker -LRB- some people say that animals , heretics , and people of another religion do not have souls -RRB- .
Like most uses of the verb to be , there is an ideology in these simple words .
One distinction often made is between soul , which is distinct from other souls , and spirit which may be combined with that of other beings .
The idea of the Holy Spirit in Christianity , for example , is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of , and which is expressed on Earth in that faith by `` the Church '' meaning `` the body of Christ '' meaning `` all bodies that follow Jesus . ''
This could be more inclusive than the is\/has view of souls and bodies .
Reincarnation is a belief that says that after the body dies , the soul will be born again in another body .
Soap is a chemical compound resulting from the reaction of an alkali -LRB- commonly sodium or potassium hydroxide -RRB- with a fatty acid .
When mixed with water during bathing or washing , they help people and clothes get clean by lowering the chance of dirt and oil to get to the skin or fabric .
Soaps are made from animal fats or vegetable oils .
There are two basic steps in making soap .
They are called Saponification and Salting-out of soap .
Soap cleans very well in soft water .
It is not toxic to water life .
It can be broken down by bacteria .
However , it is slightly soluble in water , so it is not often used in washing machines .
It does not work well in hard water .
It can not be used in strongly acidic solutions .
Many soap experts say that soap can be made in many ways .
Man has used soap-like things for at least 4000 years .
The earliest recorded evidence of the making of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in Ancient Babylon .
A recipe for soap having water , alkali and cassia oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC .
The Ebers papyrus -LRB- Egypt , 1550 BC -RRB- looks like that ancient Egyptians bathed commonly and had animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to make a soap-like substance .
Egyptian documents says that a soap-like substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving .
A summary is a short version of something , for instance a movie or a book or an article .
It tells you the main things in the movie or article or book in a short way and leaving out the details -LRB- the less important things -RRB- .
Many scientific journals publish a summary for every large article so people who do not have much time can read the main information quickly without spending too much time reading the article .
A service is a job or work done for someone else .
Often , the person who gives the service will get something in return for the service .
The person who gives the service can get money in return .
The person who gives the service can get goods in return .
The person who gives the service can get another service in return .
This is a type of trade .
All the service trades in a place form a service economy .
The service economy can be in a region like a country or in a town or city .
There are several meanings of the word sense .
This page is for disambiguation - there are more detailed articles on each meaning :
When a word has several meanings , one can refer to it as being used `` in the sense of ... '' some context or other .
In Simple English for instance we avoid using words in unusual senses .
A valid seventh sense is the immune system 's ability to detect invading virus and bacteria .
Memory is sometimes listed as an eighth sense , although it seems not to detect things from outside , but reconstruct them from inside the brain , and sometimes from muscle memory .
The obsolete term `` sixth sense '' is used to mean empathy or telepathy , and was in use before kinesthetics was understood .
When someone does not like the ideology or logic used in an argument , they often say it makes no sense or is nonsense .
A variation of this is to say that something does not make `` economic sense '' .
Usually these words signal a political dispute or some failure to define terms correctly .
The term `` common sense '' is used to mean either wisdom or very stupid ideas shared by many `` common '' people .
It has a long history of being used in politics , to mean almost anything .
A synagogue is a place where Jews meet to worship and pray to God .
In Hebrew , a synagogue is called beit knesset , which means , a `` house of gathering '' .
The word `` synagogue '' comes from sunagoge , which is a Greek word .
In a synagogue , Jews do the Jewish services , which are prayers , sometimes with special actions .
A synagogue will always have a big room for prayers .
There might be some smaller rooms for studying .
There will be some offices .
There will also usually be a big room for special events .
The front of a synagogue faces towards Jerusalem in Israel .
In the front is the holiest part of the synagogue , the Ark. .
This is a closet which has the Torah scrolls inside .
The Torah scrolls have the holy writings of Judaism on them .
The Ark usually has a curtain in front of it .
On top of the Ark is light which is always lit , called the â Eternal Lampâ .
It is a symbol which means that God is always there .
Every synagogue has a raised platform called the â Bimahâ .
The person who reads the Torah scroll stands there when he reads .
The Bimah is either in the middle of the hall , or in front of the Ark.
In some synagogues men and women sit in different places .
Some synagogues even have a short wall so that they can not see each other .
This is so that the people will think about the prayers better .
Jews may call synagogues by different names .
Many Orthodox and Conservative Jews living in English-speaking countries use the name `` synagogue '' or `` shul . ''
Jews who speak Spanish or Portuguese call synagogues esnoga .
Some Jews call the synagogue a temple .
Jewish worship does not have to be carried out in a synagogue it can be wherever ten jews Some synagogues have a separate room or torah study , this room is called the beth midrash meaning house of study assemble .
Jewish worship can be done alone or with less than ten people assembled together aswell .
Scarcity in economics is used to describe the lack of various forms of capital .
Scarcity can be used to describe an economic situation in economics , or it can be used to describe more general situations .
In economics , scarcity is the result of people having `` Unlimited Wants and Needs , '' or always wanting something new , and having `` Limited Resources . ''
Limited Resources means that there are never enough resources , or materials , to satisfy , or fulfill , the wants and needs that every person have .
Scarcity is called the `` basic economic problem , '' meaning that is always exists .
Scarcity exists due to the effects of nature such as drought , floods , storms , pest infestation , fire and other things .
Real scarcity can also exist by over use of non-renewable resources .
Goods -LRB- things -RRB- and services are also scarce because there are only a limited number of things in the world and due to the limits of technology and our own priorities .
Theatre -LRB- British English and also American English -RRB- , or Theater -LRB- American English only -RRB- , has several meanings .
The word comes originally from the Greek Theatron , meaning roughly , ' a place to behold ' .
In American English , the word ` theater ' can mean either a place where films are shown -LRB- this is also called a cinema -RRB- or a place where live stage plays are performed .
In British English , ` theater ' means a place where live plays are performed .
` Theatre ' or ` Theater ' can also mean the business of putting on plays .
An actor might say `` I am in the theater business '' , or a writer might say `` I write for the theater '' , meaning that they write plays , rather than writing for movies or television shows .
Main article : Theatre of Ancient Greece The first people we know created plays were the Ancient Greeks , about the year 500 A.D. .
They divided plays into two kinds : tragedy and comedy .
This division is still used today .
The best known Ancient Greek writers of plays are Aeschylus , Sophocles , Euripides and Aristophanes .
Some of their plays survived , and are still performed today .
These ancient Greek plays were performed outdoors in large amphitheatres , so that many people could see them .
There were contests among the playwrights -LRB- people who write plays are called playwrights -RRB- and the winner would get a prize .
The Greeks were full of brilliant ideas .
They used mechanical devices like trap doors and the machina : a crane for winching gods on and off the stage -LRB- hence ` Deus ex machina ' -RRB- .
They had a Greek chorus that offered information to help the audience follow the performance .
The chorus comments on themes , and shows how an audience might react to the drama .
The players wore masks .
Illustrations on vases show helmet-like masks , covering the entire face and head , with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth , plus a wig .
The mask was to â meltâ into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role .
Therefore , onlookers did not think about the actor , but thought about the character .
In the Middle Ages , the Christian church began to use theater as a way of telling the stories from the Bible to people who did not know how to read .
They wrote Mystery Plays , where each part of the Bible story would be a play put on by a different group of people .
They also wrote Miracle Plays which were plays about the lives of the saints .
There were also Morality plays which taught the audiences how to live a good Christian life .
In the 1500s , groups of actors who would tour around Italy performing comic plays to entertain townspeople .
These plays were called Commedia dell ` arte , and different stories would be created around the same group of characters .
Often the spoken lines would be made up by the actors for each performance .
Other kinds of plays called Neoclassical Dramas and Neoclassical Comedies were also popular in Italy and in France at this time .
These plays were written to copy the style of the plays from Ancient Greece and Rome .
At the end of the sixteenth century -LRB- the 1500s -RRB- , the traveling actors began to perform in fixed theater buildings .
This was the period when William Shakespeare wrote .
He lived from 1564 to 1616 .
At that time , in England , women were not allowed to perform , so male actors would play female characters .
His theater was in London , England .
It was called The Globe .
It was an outdoor theater and plays were performed in the daytime for large audiences .
His plays were very popular and are many are still performed today .
Many scholars and theater people believe Shakespeare was one of the best playwrights -LRB- a writer of plays -RRB- .
He wrote many kinds of plays : tragedies , comedies , romances and also history plays .
All of his plays are written in beautiful , poetic language .
Shakespeare often wrote plays set in Italy or in exotic , far-away places that would be interesting to London audiences .
His plays are still popular today for many reasons .
His characters -LRB- the people in his plays -RRB- are interesting and talk about interesting ideas .
The stories he tells in his plays are often exciting , very funny -LRB- in the comedies -RRB- , or very sad -LRB- in the tragedies -RRB- and make you want to know what happens to his characters .
He also talks in his plays about things we still think about today , like love , sadness , hope , pride , hatred , jealousy , and foolishness .
After World War II , playwrights in Europe and the United States began doing plays in a new style called `` Theatre of the Absurd . ''
After seeing the horrors of war , these playwrights felt that all their old values had been destroyed .
Playwrights such as Samuel Beckett , EugÃ ne Ionesco , Harold Pinter , and Jean Genet wrote plays that are considered to be `` Theatre of the Absurd . ''
The `` Theatre of the Absurd '' plays have some of the same ideas that are found in the philosophy -LRB- a way of thinking -RRB- called existentialism .
Existentialism is very different from many other philosophies .
Most religions and philosopies say that human life has a meaning -LRB- or a purpose -RRB- .
The philosophy of existentialism is that human life does not have a meaning -LRB- or a purpose -RRB- .
When something has no meaning , it is `` absurd '' .
-LRB- absurd means means silly and meaningless . -RRB-
The plays written in this style make people think about questions like `` what is it like to be a person in the world ? ''
and `` what does it mean for a person to be free ? ''
They are often filled with sad emotions , such as worry , fear , and thoughts about death .
There are many other types of plays performed in the theater today .
Theatre breaks are a form of short holiday , based around viewing a theatrical show .
Theatre breaks tend to include a nights hotel accommodation included in the price .
Some theater breaks websites have been trading for over 20 years .
This is a demonstrative pronoun used to identify a noun .
It describes something that is here or nearby -LRB- `` This ball I am holding is red . ''
or `` This is my home . '' -RRB- .
A very easy way to tell if someone is using this the right way is if the object that they are talking about can be pointed to .
For example , if someone says `` this computer is mine , '' it should be possible to point to the computer .
It does not matter if the computer -LRB- a noun -RRB- is in the room or in a picture .

However , you may accept compensation in exchange for copies .
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3 .
You may also lend copies , under the same conditions stated above , and you may publicly display copies .
If you publish printed copies -LRB- or copies in media that commonly have printed covers -RRB- of the Document , numbering more than 100 , and the Document 's license notice requires Cover Texts , you must enclose the copies in covers that carry , clearly and legibly , all these Cover Texts : Front-Cover Texts on the front cover , and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover .
Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies .
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible .
You may add other material on the covers in addition .
Copying with changes limited to the covers , as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions , can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects .

In addition , you must do these things in the Modified Version :
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document , you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant .
To do this , add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version 's license notice .
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles .
You may add a section Entitled `` Endorsements '' , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties -- for example , statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard .
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text , and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text , to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version .
Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by -LRB- or through arrangements made by -RRB- any one entity .
If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover , previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of , you may not add another ; but you may replace the old one , on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one .
The author -LRB- s -RRB- and publisher -LRB- s -RRB- of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version .
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License , under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions , provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents , unmodified , and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice , and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers .
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License , and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy .
If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents , make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it , in parentheses , the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known , or else a unique number .
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work .
In the combination , you must combine any sections Entitled `` History '' in the various original documents , forming one section Entitled `` History '' ; likewise combine any sections Entitled `` Acknowledgements '' , and any sections Entitled `` Dedications '' .
You must delete all sections Entitled `` Endorsements . ''
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License , and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection , provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects .
You may extract a single document from such a collection , and distribute it individually under this License , provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document , and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document .
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works , in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium , is called an `` aggregate '' if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation 's users beyond what the individual works permit .
When the Document is included in an aggregate , this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document .
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document , then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate , the Document 's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate , or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form .
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate .
Translation is considered a kind of modification , so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4 .
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders , but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections .
You may include a translation of this License , and all the license notices in the Document , and any Warranty Disclaimers , provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers .
In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer , the original version will prevail .
If a section in the Document is Entitled `` Acknowledgements '' , `` Dedications '' , or `` History '' , the requirement -LRB- section 4 -RRB- to Preserve its Title -LRB- section 1 -RRB- will typically require changing the actual title .
You may not copy , modify , sublicense , or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License .
Any other attempt to copy , modify , sublicense or distribute the Document is void , and will automatically terminate your rights under this License .
However , parties who have received copies , or rights , from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance .
The Free Software Foundation may publish new , revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time .
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version , but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns .
See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ .
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number .
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License `` or any later version '' applies to it , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published -LRB- not as a draft -RRB- by the Free Software Foundation .
If the Document does not specify a version number of this License , you may choose any version ever published -LRB- not as a draft -RRB- by the Free Software Foundation .
A time horizon is a future point in time when something must be `` done '' -LRB- a `` deadline '' -RRB- or will be `` over '' -LRB- a `` time limit '' -RRB- .
Either way , the matter will be closed when the time horizon is reached .
It is very important to know at what time horizon something you are doing will be scored , evaluated , marked or paid for .
Sports , for example football -LRB- soccer -RRB- and basketball , often have time limits .
Baseball and others do not , which sometimes causes problems .
A time limit is a time horizon that is imposed on everyone at once .
It may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics .
For instance , if poor people and rich people are debating something , a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people can not keep debating until the poor people have to go to work , and lose .
Time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results -LRB- for tax and investment purposes -RRB- at the same time .
This in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting .
However , the deadline is imposed by an authority , whereas the time limit is imposed by a system .
So there can be slack in a deadline , so that results do not have to be reported always very fast .
For example , in the United States of America , the end of the calendar year on December 31 is the time limit for taxes , but the deadline for reporting is April 15 .
Sometimes the government allows more time , as it did for the families of those who were killed in the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Taiwan -LRB- also known as Formosa -RRB- is an island country in the western Pacific and east of mainland China .
It is the nationalist government of China since 1949 .
It is called the Republic of China -LRB- ROC -RRB- -LRB- also called Nationalist China or Taiwan -RRB- which is a country comprising the island of Taiwan and nearby islands -LRB- Pescadores islands and parts of Fujian -RRB- .
The Chinese Nationalist government -LRB- Kuomintang also called KMT -RRB- escapes to Taiwan after losing the war in 1949 when mainland China was under Communist control .
Currently , the Chinese Nationalist government governs Taiwan .
The Republic of China does not want the Chinese Nationalist government to govern because the people who live in the ROC want to be able to govern their own country .
And this is the reason for the endless debate .
Taiwan is southeast of the communist mainland China , south of Japan , and north of the Philippines .
Formosa means `` beautiful island '' in Portuguese .
The largest cities on Taiwan are the capital of Taipei and Kaohsiung .
Most people living in Taiwan -LRB- sometimes called Taiwanese -RRB- are Han .
There are also Taiwanese Aborigines who lived on Taiwan before the Han came to live there .
Taiwan has three large Han groups .
They are different in language and places where their ancestors came from : the Southern Fujianese -LRB- from China 's Fujian Province -RRB- , the Hakka -LRB- from China -RRB- , and Mainlanders -LRB- from Mainland China after 1948 -RRB- .
There are two Chinese governments in the world : The People 's Republic of China -LRB- PRC -RRB- and the Republic of China -LRB- ROC -RRB- .
PRC claims control over the island of Taiwan -LRB- which is also known as Taiwan province -RRB- , which is why people want Taiwan to formally declare independence .
Today , in reality , the PRC government controls mainland China , and the ROC government governs Taiwan .
The PRC government has never occupied Taiwan .
The ROC government occupied mainland China from 1911 to 1949 , before losing control of mainland China to the communist PRC .
Today , people who live in Taiwan have different ideas .
Although many Taiwanese think there is no freedom in China , others want to be united again with China .
But most of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now , at least until China becomes free .
Today most countries of the world recognize the People 's Republic of China as China .
Even though Taiwan is not recognized by UN as a sovereign nation , most countries still have very close economic and cultural relationship with the island of Taiwan .
The government of China have said that if the people of Taiwan formally vote to become the Republic of Taiwan , they will invade Taiwan .
So , there is now a situation where both sides are not making any big changes .
In March 2004 , China 's government passed a law that will allow China to invade Taiwan if the people of Taiwan vote to become the Republic of Taiwan .
This law hurt the feelings of the people in Taiwan very much , especially since the government of mainland China does not rule Taiwan .
It has caused even more people in Taiwan to not want to be re-united with mainland China .
A trademark -LRB- or trade mark -RRB- is a way for a business to help people to identify the products that the business makes from products made by another business .
A trademark can be a name , word , phrase , symbol , logo , design , or picture .
It can only be used on things made by the business that owns the trademark .
For example , Coca-Cola and Coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by the Coca-Cola Company .
No other business can use these names or any names similar to them .
Other businesses can make a drink that is similar , like colas soft drinks , but they have to use a different name for their drink , such as Pepsi .
Another example is the Nike company which makes sporting goods like shoes and clothes .
The `` swoosh '' symbol used on their products is a trademark .
Famous trademarks like Coca-Cola and Nike are used for branding whole families of products .
Trademarks are protected by law .
In some countries , a person or company can get a trademark simply by using the name , word , phrase , symbol , logo , design , or picture on its products .
Trademarks can also be registered .
In that case , the business tells the government of its country that it wants to use a certain name , word , phrase , symbol , logo , design or picture as a trademark for the products it sells .
If no other person or business is using the trademark to sell those products , then the government will list that trademark .
Once it is listed , no one else can use that trademark for those products .
This is called `` registering '' the trademark .
If someone uses the trademark in a wrong way , the trademark owner can sue the other person .
If a court decides that the other person was not allowed to use the trademark , they might have to pay a fine to the trademark owner .
If another person wants to use a trademark that they do not own , they can ask the trademark owner for permission .
The trademark owner can grant the other person a license .
The other person usually must pay some money to the trademark owner for the license .
This can be in the form of a percentage of the cost of the product that the other person sells called a royalty .
For example , a person might pay Nike ten percent -LRB- 10 % -RRB- of the cost of each pair of shoes it sells for the right to include the Swoosh .
When people write a word that is a trademark or show a picture or symbol that is a trademark , they should say that it is a trademark .
If a trademark is not registered , they can write the word `` Trademark '' , use the abbreviation `` TM '' , or use the symbol â cents on their products .
If a trademark is registered , they can use the letter R in a circle symbol : '' Â '' .
People can also say it is a `` registered trademark '' or use the abbreviation `` Reg . ''
Trademarks are used for products .
Businesses that do things for people instead of making things are called service providers .
They can get a service mark instead of a trademark .
When people write or show a service mark , they can use the service mark symbol : '' â '' .
In the United States , the governing law for trademarks is the Lanham Act , in Germany the Markengesetz .
According to the Hebrew Bible , the Ten Commandments were rules for life given by God to the People of Israel on Mount Sinai .
The rules were written on stone tablets .
The book of Exodus speaks about Mout Sinai , the Book of Deuteronomy about `` Horeb '' .
The rules are important for Judaism and Christianity .
Sometimes these rules are also called Decalogue -LRB- from Greek , can be translated as ten statements -RRB- .
The name decalogue first occurs in the Septuagint .
The Jews received the commandments after they had left Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses .
There are different texts talking about the commandments .
Most of them are in the Bible : The Book of Exodus , Chapter 20 and the book of Deuteronomy , Chapter 5 .
The Qu ` ran also talks about them .
Both the Bible and the Qu ` ran have been translated many times .
For this reason , there are many variations in the way the commandments are written .
The Bible does not number the commandments .
Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways .
The Jews , followed by Christian Protestants , end the first commandment with `` You are to have no other gods but me . ''
as above .
Catholics and Lutherans end the first commandment at `` I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws . ''
and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man 's wife from the desire for other things he owns .
These commandments are translated from Ancient Hebrew to Simple English , so the exact words chosen can not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews .
There is a variety of interpretations of these commandments :
To `` put anyone to death without cause '' , called murder , may mean all killing including execution and war , or exclude these .
To `` be false to the married relation '' , called adultery , is when a married person has sex with a person other than his or her spouse .
The Bible does not say this includes unmarried people having sex with each other , although some people think so .
Some have interpreted Exodus 22:16 to mean that if two unmarried people have sex , they should make a commitment to one another .
To `` give false witness '' called lying , may include all lying , or only include lying in a court , called perjury .
To `` desire ... your neighbor 's house , or his wife , or his servant or his ox '' , implies that wives and servants were owned by a man in Moses ' time , although this is not so today .
Some people say that this means trying to get what the person wants , while others say it means even wanting it .
In the New Testament , Jesus talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments .
He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person , they might be judged for murder , and if they just looked with desire or lust at a woman , they had committed adultery in their heart .
The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten imperative statements , there are 14 or 15 in all .
While the Bible itself gives the count as `` 10 '' , using the Hebrew phrase Ê '' aseret had ` varimâ '' translated as the 10 words , statements or things , this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being `` the Ten Commandments '' .
Various religions divide the commandments differently .
The table below shows those differences .
Muslims reject the Bible 's version of the Ten Commandments .
Islam teaches that the Bible is a revelation from God but the text used in Judaism and Christianity has been corrupted .
The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur ` an but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran -LRB- using Jewish numbering -RRB- :
In general , religions other than those mentioned -LRB- Judaism , Christianity , Islam -RRB- do not recognize the Ten Commandments as ethical standards .
Many of them -LRB- Buddhism , Hinduism , Jainism , etc. -RRB- have similar laws or principles though .
In the atheist Soviet Union the Moral Code of the Builder of Communism was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments .
Most Christians believe that Sunday is a special day of worship and rest .
It is there to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar .
They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath-day ordinance .
These two rules are not literally identical though .
They say that this ordinance is no longer valid , because God has replaced his old creation by a new one .
For this reason , the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews .
They say there are examples in the New Testament , and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries .
Some conservative Christians are `` Sabbatarians '' .
Most of these follow the Reformed traditions .
Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or Lord 's Day is the new Sabbath .
This is because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation ordinance .
Still others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday , reserving Sunday as a day of worship .
In reference to Acts 20:7 , the disciples came together on the first day of the week -LRB- Sunday -RRB- to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul .
This is not the first time Christians assembled together on a Sunday ; Jesus appeared to the Christians on the `` first day of the week '' while they were in hiding .
One can maintain this argument in that Jesus himself maintained the Sabbath , although not within the restrictions that were mandated by Jewish traditions ; the Pharisees often tried Jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the Law -LRB- see : Luke 14:5 -RRB- .
This would seem to show that while the Sabbath was still of importance to the Jews , Sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from Scriptures .
The Seventh-day Adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views .
They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism , specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism -LRB- in which sun-god worship took place on Sunday -RRB- .
This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the seventh day holy .
Instead , they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God 's work of creation believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed .
Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century , by most until the 4th and 5th century , and a few thereafter , but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish-Roman wars , the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship .
The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church .
See Great Apostasy .
Jews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the Jewish-Roman wars .
This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath .
Hatred of Jews is apparent in the Council of Laodicea -LRB- 4th Century AD -RRB- where Canon 37 â `` 38 states : `` It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics , nor to feast together with them . ''
and `` It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews , nor to be partakers of their impiety . ''
In keeping with this rejection of the Jews , this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea : `` Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath , but must work on that day , rather honoring the Lord 's Day ; and , if they can , resting then as Christians .
But if any shall be found to be judaizers , let them be anathema -LRB- excommunicated -RRB- from Christ . ''
Various translations exist of the sixth commandment ; the Hebrew words -- are translated either as `` thou shalt not kill '' or `` thou shalt not murder '' .
Older Protestant translations of the Bible , those based on the Vulgate and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it `` Thou shalt not kill '' .
Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use `` You shall not murder '' .
There is controversy as to which translation is more faithful , and both forms are quoted in support of ethical standpoints .
The Vulgate -LRB- Latin -RRB- translation has Non occides , i.e. `` Thou shalt not kill '' .
English translations using `` kill '' include the King James -LRB- Authorised -RRB- -LRB- 1611 -RRB- -LRB- although note Matthew `` do no murder '' , following the Vulgate non homicidium facies -RRB- , the American Standard -LRB- 1901 -RRB- and Revised Standard -LRB- American Protestant , 1952 -RRB- Versions .
Almost all Roman Catholic translations , including the Douay-Rheims Bible -LRB- 1609\/1752 -RRB- , the New American Bible -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , the New Jerusalem Bible -LRB- 1985 -RRB- and the Christian Community Bible -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , have `` kill '' .
Martin Luther -LRB- German , 1534 -RRB- also uses tÃ ten -LRB- kill -RRB- .
Protestant translations using `` murder '' include the New International Version -LRB- American , 1978 -RRB- , New American Standard Bible -LRB- American , 1971 -RRB- , New English Bible -LRB- British Protestant , 1970 -RRB- , and the New King James -LRB- American , 1982 -RRB- , New Revised Standard -LRB- American , 1989 -RRB- and English Standard -LRB- American Protestant , 2001 -RRB- Versions .
Jewish translations almost all use `` murder '' , including the Jewish Publication Society of America Version -LRB- 1917 -RRB- , the Judaica Press tanach -LRB- 1963 -RRB- and the Living Torah -LRB- 1981 -RRB- .
A Jewish exception is the Artscroll or Stone Edition tanach -LRB- 1996 -RRB- .
The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God , are quoted in defense of the view that `` murder '' is more accurate .
Furthermore , the Hebrew word for `` kill '' is '' '' ' '' - `` harog '' , while the Hebrew word for `` murder '' is '' -- '' - `` retzach '' , which is found in the Ten Commandments '' -- '' - `` lo tirtzach '' .
Many academic theologians -LRB- such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt : Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -RRB- suggest that commandment `` you shall not steal '' was originally intended against stealing people â '' against abductions and slavery .
This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as `` you shall not kidnap '' -LRB- e.g. as stated by Rashi -RRB- .
Many Christians say that a very important element of the commandment not to make `` any image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above '' is `` and bow down and worship it '' .
One understanding on this comes from Roman Catholicism : they hold that `` likenesses '' may be built and used , as long as the object is not worshipped .
As a result , many Roman Catholic churches and services feature images or statues .
The Eastern Orthodox Church has a very similar position .
As a consequence , icons are venerated in some Eastern Orthodox services .
Most Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox understand this practice as fulfilling the observance of the commandment .
In their understanding , these images are not being worshipped .
Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the incarnation of an invisible God as a visible human , Jesus , makes it permissible and necessary to venerate icons .
For Jews and Muslims , veneration violates this commandment .
Jews and Muslims read this commandment as prohibiting the use of idols and images in any way .
Some Protestants will allow pictures Jesus in his human form , while refusing to make any image of God or Jesus in Heaven .
Very few Christians oppose the making of any images at all .
Some groups have been critical of the use others make of images in worship .
-LRB- See iconoclasm . -RRB-
In particular , the Orthodox have criticized the Roman Catholic use of decorative statues , Roman Catholics have criticized the Orthodox veneration of icons , and some Protestant groups have criticized the use of stained-glass windows by other denominations .
Jehovah 's Witnesses criticize the use of all of the above , as well as the use of the cross .
Amish people forbid any sort of graven image , such as photos .
The term `` Ten Commandments '' without a modifier generally applies to the lists mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 .
However , there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 -LRB- where the stones are created -RRB- , Exodus 32:19 -LRB- where the tablets are broken -RRB- and Exodus 34 .
This story lists a very different set of commandments .
This version is sometimes called `` Ritual Decalogue '' .
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the people after him who followed the documentary hypothesis , note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones .
These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments , and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments , now known as the Ritual Decalogue -LRB- as opposed to the better-known `` Ethical Decalogue '' -RRB- .
The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments .
The commandments have influenced Jewish ethics and law and , through Judaism and Christianity , Western ethics and law since the Roman Empire .
A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood .
It can live for many years .
The four main parts of a tree are the roots , the trunk , the branches , and the leaves .
The roots of a tree are usually under the ground .
One case for which this is not true are the roots of the mangrove tree .
A single tree has many roots .
The roots carry food and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree .
They can also breathe in air .
Sometimes , roots are specialized into aerial roots , which can also provide support , as is the case with the Banyan tree .
The trunk is the main body of the tree .
The trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage .
Branches grow from the trunk .
They spread out so that the leaves can get more sunlight .
The leaves of a tree are green most of the time , but they can come in many colors , shapes and sizes .
The leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow , and to reproduce .
When people look at the wood of a tree , they see rings .
One way to tell how old a tree was is to count them .
This is not always exact .
Trees and shrubs take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen .
This is the opposite of what humans do .
This helps to put more oxygen -LRB- the gas that humans breathe -RRB- into the air .
Shrubs are small plants .
A tree is a plant form that can be found in many different orders and families of plants .
Trees show many growth forms , leaf type and shape , bark traits and organs .
The tree form has changed separately in classes of plants that are not related , in response to similar problems -LRB- for the tree -RRB- .
With about 100,000 types of trees , the number of tree types in the whole world might be one fourth of all living plant types .
Most tree species grow in tropical parts of the world and many of these areas have not been surveyed yet by botanists -LRB- they study plants -RRB- , making species difference and ranges not well understood .
The earliest trees were tree ferns , horsetails and lycophytes , which grew in forests in the Carboniferous Period ; tree ferns still survive , but the only surviving horsetails and lycophytes are not of tree form .
Later , in the Triassic Period , conifers , ginkgos , cycads and other gymnosperms appeared , and subsequently flowering plants in the Cretaceous Period .
Most species of trees today are flowering plants -LRB- Angiosperms -RRB- and conifers .
A small group of trees growing together is called a grove or copse , and a landscape covered by a dense growth of trees is called a forest .
Several biotopes are defined largely by the trees that inhabit them ; examples are rainforest and taiga -LRB- see ecozones -RRB- .
A landscape of trees scattered or spaced across grassland -LRB- usually grazed or burned over periodically -RRB- is called a savanna .
A forest of great age is called old growth forest or ancient woodland -LRB- in the UK -RRB- .
A very young tree is called a sapling .
The parts of a tree are the roots , trunk -LRB- s -RRB- , branches , twigs and leaves .
Tree stems are mainly made of support and transport tissues -LRB- xylem and phloem -RRB- .
Wood consists of xylem cells , and bark is made of phloem and other tissues external to the vascular cambium .
Trees may be grouped into exogenous and endogenous trees according to the way in which their stem diameter increases .
As an exogenous -LRB- growing from outside -RRB- tree grows , it creates growth rings as new wood is laid down concentrically over the old wood .
In species growing in areas with seasonal climate changes , wood growth produced at different times of the year may be visible as alternating light and dark , or soft and hard , rings of wood .
In temperate climates , and tropical climates with a single wet-dry season alternation , the growth rings are annual , each pair of light and dark rings being one year of growth ; these are known as annual rings .
In areas with two wet and dry seasons each year , there may be two pairs of light and dark rings each year ; and in some -LRB- mainly semi-desert regions with irregular rainfall -RRB- , there may be a new growth ring with each rainfall .
In tropical rainforest regions , with constant year-round climate , growth is continuous and the growth rings are not visible nor is there a change in the wood texture .
In species with annual rings , these rings can be counted to determine the age of the tree , and used to date cores or even wood taken from trees in the past , a practice known as the science of dendrochronology .
Very few tropical trees can be accurately dated in this manner .
Age determination is also impossible in endogenous trees .
The roots of a tree are generally down in earth , providing anchorage for the above-ground biomass and absorbing -LRB- taking in -RRB- water and nutrients from the soil .
However , while ground nutrients are needed for a tree 's growth the majority of its biomass comes from carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere -LRB- see photosynthesis -RRB- .
Above ground , the trunk gives height to the leaf-bearing branches , aiding in competition with other plant species for sunlight .
In many trees , the order of the branches makes exposure of the leaves to sunlight better .
Not all trees have all the plant organs or parts as mentioned above .
For example , most palm trees are not branched , the saguaro cactus of North America has no functional leaves , tree ferns do not produce bark , etc. .
Based on their general shape and size , all of these are nonetheless generally regarded as trees .
Trees can vary very much .
A plant form that is similar to a tree , but generally having smaller , multiple trunks and\/or branches that arise near the ground , is called a shrub -LRB- or a bush -RRB- .
Even though that is true , no precise differentiation between shrubs and trees is possible .
Given their small size , bonsai plants would not technically be ` trees ' , but one should not confuse reference to the form of a species with the size or shape of individual specimens .
A spruce seedling does not fit the definition of a tree , but all spruces are trees .
The Coast Redwood : 115.56 m -LRB- 379.1 ft -RRB- , in Redwood National Park , California is believed to be the world 's tallest tree .
The tallest trees in Australia are all eucalypts , of which there are more than 700 species .
The so-called ` Mountain ash ' .
with a slim , straight trunk , grows to over 300 feet .
The stoutest living single-trunk species in diameter is the African Baobab : ' , Glencoe Baobab -LRB- measured near the ground -RRB- , Limpopo Province , South Africa .
This tree split up in November 2009 and now the stoutest baobab could be Sunland Baobab -LRB- South Africa -RRB- with diameter 10.64 m and circumference of 33.4 m.
Some trees develop multiple trunks -LRB- whether from an individual tree or multiple trees -RRB- which grow together .
The Sacred Fig is a notable example of this , forming additional ` trunks ' by growing adventitious roots down from the branches , which then thicken up when the root reaches the ground to form new trunks ; a single Sacred Fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks .
The oldest trees are determined by growth rings , which can be seen if the tree is cut down or in cores taken from the edge to the center of the tree .
Correct determination is only possible for trees which make growth rings , generally those which occur in seasonal climates ; trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates are always growing and do not have distinct growth rings .
It is also only possible for trees which are solid to the center of the tree ; many very old trees become hollow as the dead heartwood decays away .
For some of these species , age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates , but the results are usually little better than guesses or wild speculation .
White proposes a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the United Kingdom through the correlation between a tree 's stem diameter , growth character and age .
Other species suspected of reaching exceptional age include European Yew Taxus baccata -LRB- probably over 2,000 years -RRB- and Western Redcedar Thuja plicata .
The oldest known European Yew is the Llangernyw Yew in the Churchyard of Llangernyw village in North Wales which is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,000 years old .
The oldest reported age for an angiosperm tree is 2293 years for the Sri Maha Bodhi Sacred Fig -LRB- Ficus religiosa -RRB- planted in 288 BC at Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka ; this is said to be the oldest human-planted tree with a known planting date .
Studies have shown that trees contribute as much as 27 % of the appraised land value in certain markets .
These most likely use diameter measured at breast height -LRB- dbh -RRB- , 4.5 f above groundâ '' not the larger base diameter .
A general model for any year and diameter is :
assuming 2.2 % inflation per year .
Tree climbing is an activity where one moves around in the crown of trees .
Use of a rope , helmet , and harness are the minimum requirements to ensure the safety of the climber .
Other equipment can also be used depending on the experience and skill of the tree climber .
Some tree climbers take special hammocks called `` Treeboats '' and Portaledges with them into the tree canopies where they can enjoy a picnic or nap , or spend the night .
Tree climbing is an `` on rope '' activity that puts together many different tricks and gear originally derived from rock climbing and caving .
These techniques are used to climb trees for many purposes , including tree care -LRB- arborists -RRB- , animal rescue , recreation , sport , research , and activism .
The two major -LRB- big -RRB- sources of tree damage are biotic -LRB- from living sources -RRB- and abiotic -LRB- from non-living sources -RRB- .
Biotic sources would include insects which might bore into the tree , deer which might rub bark off the trunk , or fungi , which might attach themselves to the tree .
Abiotic sources include lightning , vehicles impacts , and construction activities .
Construction activities can involve a number of damage sources , including grade changes that prevent aeration to roots , spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products , or severing of branches or roots .
People can damage trees also .
Both damage sources can result in trees becoming dangerous , and the term `` hazard trees '' is commonly used by arborists , and industry groups such as power line operators .
Hazard trees are trees which due to disease or other factors are more susceptible to falling during windstorms , or having parts of the tree fall .
The process of finding the danger a tree presents is based on a process called the Quantified Tree Risk Assessment .
Trees are similar to people .
Both can take a lot of some types of damage and survive , but even small amounts of certain types of trauma can result in death .
Arborists are very aware that established trees will not tolerate any appreciable disturbance of the root system .
Even though that is true , most people and construction professionals do not realize how easily a tree can be killed .
One reason for confusion about tree damage from construction involves the dormancy of trees during winter .
Another factor is that trees may not show symptoms of damage until 24 months or longer after damage has occurred .
For that reason , persons who do not know about caring for trees may not link the actual cause with the later damaged effect .
Various organizations have long recognized the importance of construction activities that impact tree health .
The impacts are important because they can result in monetary losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs , as well as violation of government ordinances or community or subdivision restrictions .
As a result , protocols -LRB- standard ways -RRB- for tree management prior to , during and after construction activities are well established , tested and refined -LRB- changed -RRB- .
These basic steps are involved :
International standards are uniform in analyzing damage potential and sizing TPZs -LRB- tree protection zones -RRB- to minimize damage .
For mature to fully mature trees , the accepted TPZ comprises a 1.5-foot clearance for every 1 inch diameter of trunk .
That means for a 10 inch tree , the TPZ would extend 15 feet in all directions from the base of the trunk at ground level .
For young or small trees with minimal crowns -LRB- and trunks less than 4 inches in diameter -RRB- a TPZ equal to 1 foot for every inch of trunk diameter may be good enough .
That means for a 3 inch tree , the TPZ would extend 3 feet in all directions from the base of the trunk at ground level .
Detailed information on TPZs and related topics is available at minimal cost from organizations like the International Society for Arboriculture .
The tree has always been a cultural symbol .
Common icons are the World tree , for instance Yggdrasil , and the tree of life .
The tree is often used to represent nature or the environment itself .
A common mistake -LRB- wrong thing -RRB- is that trees get most of their mass from the ground .
In fact , 99 % of a tree 's mass comes from the air .
A Wish Tree -LRB- or wishing tree -RRB- is a single tree , usually distinguished by species , position or appearance , which is used as an object of wishes and offerings .
Such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value .
By tradition , believers make votive offerings in order to gain from that nature spirit , saint or goddess fulfillment of a wish .
Tree worship refers to the tendency of many societies in all of history to worship or otherwise mythologize trees .
Trees have played a very important role in many of the world 's mythologies and religions , and have been given deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages .
Human beings , seeing the growth and death of trees , the elasticity of their branches , the sensitiveness and the annual -LRB- every year -RRB- decay and revival of their foliage , see them as powerful symbols of growth , decay and resurrection .
The most ancient cross-cultural symbolic representation of the universe 's construction is the ` world tree ' .
The tree , with its branches reaching up into the sky , and roots deep into the earth , can be seen to dwell in three worlds - a link between heaven , the earth , and the underworld , uniting above and below .
It is also both a feminine symbol , bearing sustenance ; and a masculine , phallic symbol - another union .
For this reason , many mythologies around the world have the concept of the World tree , a great tree that acts as an Axis mundi , holding up the cosmos , and providing a link between the heavens , earth and underworld .
In European mythology the best known example is the tree Yggdrasil from Norse mythology .
The world tree is also an important part of Mesoamerican mythologies , where it represents the four cardinal directions -LRB- north , south , east , and west -RRB- .
The concept of the world tree is also closely linked to the motif of the Tree of life .
In literature , a mythology was notably developed by J.R.R. Tolkien , his Two Trees of Valinor playing a central role in his 1964 Tree and Leaf .
William Butler Yeats describes a `` holy tree '' in his poem The Two Trees -LRB- 1893 -RRB- .
There are many types of trees .
Here is a list of some of them :
A tragedy is a sad thing .
In theater , a tragedy is a play that ends sadly .
A tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities , but has one bad quality -LRB- called a `` tragic flaw '' -RRB- that causes trouble for him , and may cause him , or his family or friends , to be in trouble .
Often in a tragedy , there is one thing that the hero does not want to happen and tries to prevent , but no matter what he does , it makes this thing more and more sure to happen .
They originated in Ancient Greece where they were performed at religious festivals .
The three most famous Greek tragedy writers were Aeschylus , Sophocles and Euripides .
Other famous writers include Shakespeare .
Taxonomy is a science .
It is about the classification of all things living .
Although it is most commonly used in biology , it can be used in other types of classification too .
Taxonomy is used with different ranks , the lowest is a species .
There can also be sub-species .
An organism is a species if two organisms of the same kind can mate .
This name is the scientific classification of that species .
The name is the same all over the world , so that when scientists from different places talk or write about the living thing , they can understand each other .
The highest rank in the domain of living things is the Kingdom .
Each kingdom has many smaller groups in it , called Phyla : see List of animal phyla .
Each Phylum has more smaller groups in it , called Classes .
This pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them .
Each species is put into a group because of what it does , how and what it eats , special body parts , and so on .
At the end of the pattern , the groups -LRB- Genera -RRB- are very small .
Then each species in the Genus is given its own name .
When someone writes about a living thing and uses this name , they only write the Genus name and the species name , like this :
Felis silvestris catus -LRB- domestic cat -RRB- When someone writes about this animal , the first time they write its name they will write Felis silvestris catus .
After the first time they write its name , they will only write the first letter of the Genus , so they will write F. silvestris catus .
This is known as binomial nomenclature , because it is a way to describe organisms using two names , the first is the Genus name , and the second is the adjective that denotes the specific species of that genus .
A mnemonic , or a saying to help a person remember something , for that is `` King Phillip Came Over From Greater Spain '' , `` King Phillip Came Over For Good Spaghetti '' , and King Phillip Cried Out `` For Goodness Sake '' .
An important alternative approach to biological classification is cladism , a strict approach which is based on out knowledge of the course of evolution .
It uses characters -LRB- traits -RRB- to decide on the branches of the taxonomy .
A temple is a building where people go to practice their religion .
In a temple people perform religious activities like prayers and worship of God .
Thus , a temple is a general term for a house of worship .
Christians usually call their religious buildings churches .
Theft is a crime .
It is when one person or group takes from another person , business , or state any object , money , service , or information without permission .
A person who has been convicted of theft may be called a thief .
However , the practice of engaging in theft is also called stealing .
There are many different types of theft , such as burglary , armed robbery and shoplifting .
Theft is also known as permanent borrowing .
Stealing is a basic crime , and is illegal almost everywhere .
Thieves steal things sometimes because they want to have something for themselves , or because they want to sell something for money .
Sometimes thieves will come up with plans to rob a store , bank , house , or person , and sometimes they will just see a chance to steal something and take it .
When thieves steal things for money , they usually pick cars , electronics , laptops , or other things they can sell easily .
Sometimes thieves use pawn shops to sell things easily to someone who will not ask questions .
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , usually shortened to the United Kingdom , GB or UK , is a sovereign state in northwest Europe .
It is made up of four countries : England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales .
The country is a member of the European Union , the United Nations , NATO and the G8 .
It has the sixth largest economy in the world .
About 61 million people live in the UK .
Most people in the UK speak English .
There are several other native languages , other than English .
They are Welsh in Wales , Gaelic and Scots in Scotland and Northern Ireland , Irish in Northern Ireland , and Cornish in Cornwall .
Between the 17th and mid 20th-centuries Britain was an important world power and built a colonial empire that gave it control over large areas of Africa , Asia , North America and Oceania .
Today this empire does not exist , although Britain retains links with some of its former empire .
Some well-known cities in the UK include London , Edinburgh , Cardiff , Belfast , Manchester , Liverpool , Birmingham and Glasgow .
From archaeological remains we know that England was first inhabited by hunter-gatherers after the last ice age ended .
The exact date is not known : perhaps as early as 8000BC but certainly by 5000BC .
They built mesolithic wood and stone monuments , of which Stonehenge is one of the latest .
Later , Celtic tribes arrived from mainland Europe , followed by the Julius Caesar and the Romans around 32AD .
History begins when there is a written record , and writing , like so much else , was brought to Britain by the Romans .
Rome ruled in Britain 44AD to 410AD , but they ruled only England and Wales .
The Romans never ruled Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth valley , or Ireland ; their northern boundary varied from time to time , and was marked for a while at Hadrian 's Wall .
After the Romans , two waves of immigrants came to Britain .
The first were Vikings , and the second were from German tribes : the Angles , Saxons and Jutes .
English , the language , is a development from Anglo-Saxon Old English , and is a Germanic language .
After a long period when England was divided into various kingdoms , it was finally made into one country by Ã thelstan -LRB- Athelstan -RRB- in 945AD .
England and Wales were unified by Edward I -LRB- Longshanks -RRB- by force in the 13th century .
This union is known as Britain .
Union with Scotland took much longer ; there were hundreds of years of conflicts between them .
This union is known as Great Britain .
In 1603 , when Queen Elizabeth I of England died , her closest relative was King James VI of Scotland .
He became king of England as well as king of Scotland , but the two countries stayed separate .
In 1707 , the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union , which joined the two countries into one country called The Kingdom of Great Britain under Queen Anne .
By 1800 , both Scotland and England had already independently had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years .
In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states .
The new country was called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .
In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State -LRB- now called Ireland -RRB- from the United Kingdom .
However , six northern counties -LRB- called Northern Ireland -RRB- continue to be part of the United Kingdom .
The country was renamed The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
The British people today are ruled by Parliament , not by monarchs .
Parliament started a thousand years ago as an advisory body for the monarch , but by the 17th century it had gained enough power to successfully defeat Charles I , in the English Civil War .
Oliver Cromwell became Lord Protector .
Though the monarchy was restored after his death , the Crown gradually became the secondary power , and Parliament the first .
Members of Parliament -LRB- called MPs -RRB- were elected , but until the early twentieth century , only men who owned property could vote .
In the nineteenth century , more people were given suffrage -LRB- the right to vote -RRB- , but even so , by 1900 , women could not vote , and only 40 % of men were rich enough to vote .
But in 1928 , all adults , male and female , got the vote : this is called universal suffrage .
Parliament is in London , but it has power over the whole of the UK .
Today , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own parliaments as well , but they have more limited powers .
There are also parliaments in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands , which are islands that are partly controlled by the UK , and partly independent .
The members of Parliament belong to political parties : the biggest parties are the Labor Party , the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats .
Members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together .
A party with more than half the seats -LRB- a majority -RRB- forms the government ; the leader of the party becomes the Prime Minister , who then appoints other ministers .
Because the government has a majority in Parliament , it can normally control what laws are passed .
Major languages spoken in the United Kingdom other than English include Polish -LRB- 500,000 - approximate number of speakers in the UK -RRB- , -LRB- Eastern Panjabi or Punjabi -LRB- 471,000 -RRB- , Bengali -LRB- 400,000 -RRB- , Urdu -LRB- 400,000 -RRB- , Cantonese -LRB- 300,000 -RRB- , Greek -LRB- 200,000 -RRB- , Southwestern Caribbean Creole English -LRB- 170,000 -RRB- .
The UK is made up of four different countries : Wales , England , Scotland and Northern Ireland .
The capital city of Wales is Cardiff .
The capital city of England is London .
The capital city of Scotland is Edinburgh and the capital city of Northern Ireland is Belfast .
Other large cities in the UK are Birmingham , Bristol , Manchester , Liverpool , Newcastle upon Tyne , Leeds , Sheffield , Glasgow , Southampton , Leicester , Coventry , Bradford and Nottingham .
The UK is north-west off the coast of mainland Europe .
Around the UK are the North Sea , the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean .
The UK is also rules , usually indirectly , a number of smaller places -LRB- mostly islands -RRB- round the world , which are known as overseas territories .
They are remnants of the once great British Empire .
The weather of the United Kingdom is changeable and unpredictable .
Summers are moderately warm , winters are cool to cold .
Rain falls throughout the year , and more on the west than the east .
The reasons include its northerly latitude and the warm water from the Atlantic Ocean 's Gulf Stream .
The usually moderate prevailing winds from the Atlantic may be interrupted by Arctic air from the north-east or , less often , hot air from the Sahara .
The UK is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitutional and hereditary monarchy .
The people of the United Kingdom vote for a members of Parliament to speak for them and to make laws for them .
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK and is the head of state .
Even though she is the head of state , she does not decide policy .
Policy is decided by the government , under the direction of the Prime Minister .
Today , the Prime Minister is David Cameron , who is the leader of the Conservative party .
Parliament , where laws are made , has three constituent parts : the House of Commons and the House of Lords and the Queen in Parliament .
The House of Commons holds primacy .
The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons , as has every Prime Minister since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902 .
The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by the people .
Most peers are now appointed by the government .
There are some who are hereditary peers -LRB- their fathers were peers -RRB- ; and a few others , such as certain bishops in the established Church of England , and the Judiciary -LRB- Law Lords -RRB- .
The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords : they are elected by the larger total of hereditary peers .
There are two other hereditary peers in the House of Lords because they also have jobs to do on state occasions .
Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education , health and Scottish law .
Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament .
The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time .
The UK is a developed country with fifth largest economy in the world .
It was a superpower during the 18th , 19th and early 20th century and was considered since the early 1800 's to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world , in politics , economics -LRB- For it was the wealthiest country at the time . -RRB-
and in military strength .
Britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until 1908 and the largest economy until the 1920s .
The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the British Empire in the mid 20th century reduced its leading role in global affairs .
The UK still has strong economic , cultural , military and political influence and is a nuclear power .
It is a member state of the European Union .
The UK holds a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council , and is a member of the G8 , NATO , World Trade Organization and the Commonwealth of Nations .
London , the capital , is famous as being the largest center of finance in the world , along with New York City in the United States .
William Shakespeare is perhaps the most famous English playwright .
He wrote plays in the late 16th century including Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth .
In the 19th century , Jane Austen and Charles Dickens were popular novelists .
Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist H.G. Wells and J.R.R. Tolkien .
The children 's fantasy Harry Potter series is written by J.K. Rowling .
Aldous Huxley was also from the United Kingdom also Jacqueline Wilson was a famous author who wrote a child 's favorite book called Tracy Beaker .
English literature is written by authors from many countries .
The UK has eight Nobel laureates in literature .
Seamus Heaney is a well-known writer who was born in Northern Ireland .
Arthur Conan Doyle from Scotland wrote the Sherlock Holmes detective novels .
He was from Edinburgh .
The poet Dylan Thomas has brought Welsh culture to international attention .
England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales have separate , but similar , systems of education .
They have in common that education is required from ages five to sixteen .
The majority of children attend state schools but a small proportion attend private schools .
Britain 's most well known universities include the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford , as well as the London universities -LRB- University College London , the London School of Economics , King 's College London and Imperial College London -RRB- which collectively form the ` Golden Triangle ' of UK universities .
A broader group of twenty universities form the Russell Group , which account for two thirds of reseach grants and contract funding out of the total of 100 universities .
Road traffic in the United Kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road -LRB- unlike the Americas and some of the rest of Europe -RRB- , and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle .
The road network on the island of Great Britain is extensive , with most local and rural roads having evolved from Roman and Medieval times .
Major routes developed in the mid 20th Century were adapted to the needs of the motor car .
The high speed motorway -LRB- freeway -RRB- network was mostly constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and links together major towns and cities .
The system of rail transport was invented in England , so the United Kingdom has the oldest railway network in the world .
It was built mostly during the Victorian era .
At the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from London to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions .
The newest part of the network connects London to the Channel Tunnel from St Pancras station and is built to the same standard as the French TGV system .
The network is part privatised , with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions , whilst the tracks , signals and stations are owned by a Government controlled company called Network Rail .
The system of underground railways in London , known as the Tube , has been copied by many other cities .
Most domestic air travel in the United Kingdom is between London and the major cities in Scotland and the North of England .
London-Heathrow is the nationâ s largest airport and is one of the most important international hubs in the world .
Other major airports with principal international service include London-Gatwick , Birmingham , Manchester and Glasgow .
An extensive system of ferry networks operate between the Scottish islands , and major ferry routes operate between England and France -LRB- via the English Channel -RRB- , Scotland-Northern Ireland -LRB- via the Irish Sea -RRB- and England\/Wales-Republic of Ireland -LRB- from Liverpool\/Holyhead -RRB- .
The universe is commonly defined as everything that exists .
It includes all kinds of physical matter and energy , the planets , stars , galaxies , and all the contents of space .
Earlier stages in the development of the universe can be seen at great distances .
Observations suggest that the universe has been governed by the same physical laws and constants throughout most of its extent and history .
In recorded history , various cosmologies have been proposed to account for what people saw in the sky .
Most early models thought the Earth was the center of the Universe .
Some ancient Greeks thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever .
They thought it had a set of spheres which corresponded to the fixed stars , the Sun and various planets .
The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving Earth .
Over the centuries , more precise observations and better ideas of gravity led to Copernicus 's Sun-centred model .
This was hugely controversial at the time , and was fought long and hard by authorities of the Christian church -LRB- see Giordano Bruno and Galileo -RRB- .
The invention of the telescope in the Netherlands , 1608 , was a milestone in astronomy .
By the mid-19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished .
The modern optical -LRB- uses visible light -RRB- telescope is still more advanced .
Meanwhile , the Newtonian dynamics -LRB- equations -RRB- showed how the Solar System worked .
The improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realize that the Solar System is in a galaxy made of millions of stars , the Milky Way , and that other galaxies exist outside it , as far as machines can reach .
Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to much of modern cosmology .
Discovery of the red shift showed that the Universe is expanding -LRB- see Hubble -RRB- .
The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the Big Bang theory .
The Universe expanded from a very hot , dense phase called the Planck epoch , in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated .
Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and , more generally , the Big Bang idea .
Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of dark energy .
Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which can not be detected by present methods .
This has been named dark matter .
Just to be clear , dark matter and energy have not been detected directly -LRB- that is why they are called ` dark ' -RRB- .
Their existence is inferred by deduction from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise .
Current thinking in cosmology is that the age of the Universe is 13.73 -LRB- Â 0.12 -RRB- billion years , and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion light years , or 8.80 metres .
According to general relativity , space can get bigger faster than the speed of light , but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light .
We can not see space beyond the limitations of light -LRB- or any electromagnetic radiation -RRB- .
The word Universe comes from the Old French word Univers , which comes from the Latin word universum .
The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern English word is used .
A different interpretation -LRB- way to interpret -RRB- of unvorsum is `` everything rotated as one '' or `` everything rotated by one '' .
This refers to an early Greek model of the Universe .
In that model , all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth ; according to Aristotle , the rotation of the outermost sphere was responsible for the motion and change of everything within .
It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the Earth , because careful astronomical and physical measurements -LRB- such as the Foucault pendulum -RRB- are required to prove otherwise .
The most common term for `` Universe '' among the ancient Greek philosophers from Pythagoras onwards was Ï Î Ï Î Î 1\/2 -LRB- The All -RRB- , defined as all matter -LRB- Ï Î Î Î '' Î Î 1\/2 -RRB- and all space -LRB- Ï Î Î Î Î 1\/2 Î Î 1\/2 -RRB- .
The broadest word meaning of the Universe is found in De divisione naturae by the mediaeval philosopher Johannes Scotus Eriugena , who defined it as simply everything : everything that exists and everything that does not exist .
Time is not considered in Eriugena 's definition ; thus , his definition includes everything that exists , has existed and will exist , as well as everything that does not exist , has never existed and will never exist .
This all-embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers , but something similar is in quantum physics .
Usually the Universe is thought to be everything that exists , has existed , and will exist .
This definition says that the Universe is made of two elements : space and time , together known as space-time or the vacuum ; and matter and different forms of energy and momentum occupying space-time .
The two kinds of elements behave according to physical laws , in which we describe how the elements interact .
A similar definition of the term Universe is everything that exists at a single moment of time , such as the present or the beginning of time , as in the sentence `` The Universe was of size 0 '' .
In Aristotle 's book The Physics , Aristotle divided Ï Î Ï Î Î 1\/2 -LRB- everything -RRB- into three roughly analogous elements : matter -LRB- the stuff of which the Universe is made -RRB- , form -LRB- the arrangement of that matter in space -RRB- and change -LRB- how matter is created , destroyed or altered in its properties , and similarly , how form is altered -RRB- .
Physical laws were the rules governing the properties of matter , form and their changes .
Later philosophers such as Lucretius , Averroes , Avicenna and Baruch Spinoza altered or refined these divisions .
For example , Averroes and Spinoza have active principles governing the Universe which act on passive elements .
It is possible to form space-times , each existing but not able to touch , move , or change -LRB- interact with each other .
An easy way to think of this is a group of separate soap bubbles , in which people living on one soap bubble can not interact with those on other soap bubbles .
According to one common terminology , each `` soap bubble '' of space-time is denoted as a universe , whereas our particular space-time is denoted as the Universe , just as we call our moon the Moon .
The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the multiverse .
In principle , the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of space-time , different forms of matter and energy , and different physical laws and physical constants , although such possibilities are currently speculative .
According to a still-more-restrictive definition , the Universe is everything within our connected space-time that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa .
According to the general idea of relativity , some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe , due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space .
For example , radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space , even if the Universe would exist forever ; space may expand faster than light can traverse it .
It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are ; yet we can never interact with them , even in principle .
The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the observable universe .
Strictly speaking , the observable universe depends on the location of the observer .
By traveling , an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space-time than an observer who remains still , so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter .
Nevertheless , even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space .
Typically , the observable universe is taken to mean the universe observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy .
The Universe is huge and possibly infinite in volume .
The matter which can be seen is spread over a space at least 93 billion light years across .
For comparison , the diameter of a typical galaxy is only 30,000 light-years , and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is only 3 million light-years .
As an example , our Milky Way Galaxy is roughly 100,000 light years in diameter , and our nearest sister galaxy , the Andromeda Galaxy , is located roughly 2.5 million light years away .
There are probably more than 100 billion -LRB- 1011 -RRB- galaxies in the observable universe .
Typical galaxies range from dwarf galaxys with as few as ten million -LRB- 107 -RRB- stars up to giants with one trillion -LRB- 1012 -RRB- stars , all orbiting the galaxy 's center of mass. .
Thus , a very rough estimate from these numbers would suggest there are around one sextillion -LRB- 1021 -RRB- stars in the observable universe ; though a 2003 study by Australian National University astronomers resulted in a figure of 70 sextillion -LRB- 7 x 1022 -RRB- .
The matter that can be seen is spread throughout the universe , when averaged over distances longer than 300 million light-years .
However , on smaller length-scales , matter is observed to form ` clumps ' , many atoms are condensed into stars , most stars into galaxies , most galaxies into galaxy groups and clusters and , lastly , the largest-scale structures such as the Great Wall of galaxies .
The present overall density of the Universe is very low , roughly 9.9 Ã -- 10 â 30 grams per cubic centimetre .
This mass-energy appears to consist of 73 % dark energy , 23 % cold dark matter and 4 % ordinary matter .
The density of atoms is about a single hydrogen atom for every four cubic meters of volume .
The properties of dark energy and dark matter are not known .
Dark matter slows the expansion of the Universe .
Dark energy makes its expansion faster .
The Universe is old , and changing .
The best good guess of the Universe 's age is 13.73 Â 0.12 billion years old , based on what was seen of the cosmic microwave background radiation .
Independent estimates -LRB- based on measurements such as radioactive dating -RRB- agree , although they are less precise , ranging from 11 â `` 20 billion years to 13 â `` 15 billion years .
The universe has not been the same at all times in its history .
This getting bigger accounts for how Earth-bound pople can see the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away , even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years ; the very space between them has expanded .
This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted ; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey .
The rate of this spatial expansion is accelerating , based on studies of Type Ia supernovae and other data .
The relative amounts of different chemical elements â '' especially the lightest atoms such as hydrogen , deuterium and helium â '' seem to be identical in all of the universe and throughout all of the history of it that we know of .
The universe seems to have much more matter than antimatter .
The Universe appears to have no net electric charge , and therefore gravity appears to be the dominant interaction on cosmological length scales .
The Universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum .
The absence of net charge and momentum would follow if the universe were finite .
The Universe appears to have a smooth space-time continuum made of three spatial dimensions and one temporal -LRB- time -RRB- dimension .
On the average , space is very nearly flat -LRB- close to zero curvature -RRB- , meaning that Euclidean geometry is experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe .
However , the universe may have more dimensions and its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology .
The Universe seems to be governed throughout by the same physical laws and physical constants .
According to the prevailing Standard Model of physics , all matter is composed of three generations of leptons and quarks , both of which are fermions .
These elementary particles interact via at most three fundamental interactions : the electroweak interaction which includes electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force ; the strong nuclear force described by quantum chromodynamics ; and gravity , which is best described at present by general relativity .
The idea of special relativity is thought to hold in all of the universe , provided that the spatial and temporal length scales are sufficiently short ; otherwise , general relativity must be applied .
There is no explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear to have throughout our Universe , such as Planck 's constant h or the gravitational constant G. Several conservation laws have been identified , such as the conservation of charge , conservation of momentum , conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy .
Accurate predictions of the universe 's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation .
The best theory available is Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , which has passed all experimental tests so far .
However , since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on cosmological length scales , general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate .
Nevertheless , its predictions appear to be consistent with observations , so there is no reason to adopt another theory .
General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric -LRB- Einstein 's field equations -RRB- that must be solved from the distribution of mass-energy and momentum throughout the universe .
Since these are unknown in exact detail , cosmological models have been based on the cosmological principle , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .
In effect , this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density .
The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein 's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales .
Einstein 's field equations include a cosmological constant -LRB- Lamda : Î -RRB- , that is related to an energy density of empty space .
Depending on its sign , the cosmological constant can either slow -LRB- negative Î -RRB- or accelerate -LRB- positive Î -RRB- the expansion of the universe .
Although many scientists , including Einstein , had speculated that Î was zero , recent astronomical observations of type Ia supernovae have detected a large amount of dark energy that is accelerating the universe 's expansion .
Preliminary studies suggest that this dark energy is related to a positive Î , although alternative theories can not be ruled out as yet .
The distances between the spinning galaxies increase with time , but the distances between the stars within each galaxy stay roughly the same , due to their gravitational interactions .
This animation illustrates a closed Friedmann universe with zero cosmological constant Î ; such a universe oscillates between a Big Bang and a Big Crunch .
The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above , such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies , the universal ratio of hydrogen : helium atoms , and the ubiquitous , isotropic microwave radiation background .
As noted above , the redshift arises from the metric expansion of space ; as the space itself expands , the wavelength of a photon traveling through space likewise increases , decreasing its energy .
The longer a photon has been traveling , the more expansion it has undergone ; hence , older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted .
Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental physical cosmology .
Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics .
As the universe expands , the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter , since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength .
Thus , although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter , it was once dominated by radiation ; poetically speaking , all was light .
As the universe expanded , its energy density decreased and it became cooler ; as it did so , the elementary particles of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations .
Thus , in the early part of the matter-dominated era , stable protons and neutrons formed , which then associated into atomic nuclei .
At this stage , the matter in the universe was mainly a hot , dense plasma of negative electrons , neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei .
Nuclear reactions among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei , particularly hydrogen , deuterium , and helium .
Eventually , the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms , which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation ; at this point , the radiation decoupled from the matter , forming the ubiquitous , isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today .
Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics .
According to the prevailing theory , a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the universe 's creation , or developed very shortly thereafter .
Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another , producing photons , a small residue of matter survived , giving the present matter-dominated universe .
Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid cosmic inflation of the universe occurred very early in its history -LRB- roughly 10 â 35 seconds after its creation -RRB- .
Recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant -LRB- Î -RRB- is not zero and that the net mass-energy content of the universe is dominated by a dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized scientifically .
They differ in their gravitational effects .
Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does , and thus slows the expansion of the universe ; by contrast , dark energy serves to accelerate the universe 's expansion .
Some people think that there is more than one Universe .
They think that there is a set of universes called the multiverse .
By definition , there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another .
The multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it .
An idea that can not be tested is not science .
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in the Solar System .
It is a gas giant .
It is the third largest planet in the solar system .
The planet is made of ice , gases and liquid metal .
Its atmosphere contains hydrogen , helium and methane .
The temperature on Uranus is â ' 197 degrees C -LRB- 79 K -RRB- .
The planet is tilted on its axis so much that it is sideways .
Uranus completes its turn around the Sun in 84 earth years .
It completes its turn around itself in 17 hours and 14 minutes .
This means there are about 43,000 days in 1 uranian year .
The distance between Uranus and Neptune is 1.6 billion km .
Uranus was discovered in 1781 .
Uranus has 11 rings which are hard to see from earth .
This planet can be seen with the naked eye under perfect conditions .
Some evidence suggests that this planet was catalogued as a star -LRB- 34 Tauri -RRB- before its confirmed discovery .
Uranus is named after the Greek god Uranus , who was a god of sky .
Uranus has 27 known moons .
The names for these moons are chosen from characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope .
The five biggest moons are Miranda , Ariel , Umbriel , Titania and Oberon .
Many moons yet have been discovered .
They remain a mystery .
In 1986 , NASA 's Voyager 2 visited Uranus .
The visit is the only attempt to investigate the planet from a short distance .
Uranus is covered in blue clouds .
The clouds , made of methane , are difficult to see as they are low in the atmosphere .
There are also violent storms on the surface with winds that blow at 160 miles per hour .
Scientists are studying the clouds to try and understand the storms on the planet .
The planet Uranus has a system made of 13 rings between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune .
The rings of Uranus were discovered on March 10 , 1977 , by James L. Elliot , Edward W. Dunham , and Douglas J. Mink .
More than 200 years ago , William Herschel also reported observing rings , but modern astronomers do not believe that he saw them , because they are very dark and faint .
Two additional rings were discovered in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 , and two outer rings were found in 2003 â `` 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope .
As of 2010 people know that the Uranian ring system have 13 rings .

They are probably composed of water ice .
The rings of Uranus are thought to be relatively young , not more than 600 million years old .
The Uranian ring system probably began from the collisional fragmentation of moons that once existed around the planet .
After colliding , the moons probably broke up into many particles , which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability .
As we know currently , the ring system of Uranus has thirteen distinct rings .

They can be divided into three groups : nine narrow main rings -LRB- 6 , 5 , 4 , Î , Î , Î , Î , Î , Î -RRB- , two dusty rings -LRB- 1986U2R \/ Î , Î '' -RRB- and two outer rings -LRB- Î 1\/4 , Î 1\/2 -RRB- .
The rings of Uranus consist mainly of macroscopic particles and little dust , although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R \/ Î , Î , Î , Î '' , Î 1\/2 and Î 1\/4 rings .
In addition to these well-known rings , there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them .
These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily or consist of a number of separate arcs , which are sometimes detected during occultations .
Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007 .
A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2 .
All rings of Uranus show azimuthal brightness variations .
The rings are made of an extremely dark material .
The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and gray in near-infrared .
They exhibit no identifiable spectral features .
The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known .
However , they can not be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark , darker than the inner moons of Uranus .
This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material .
The nature of this material is not clear , but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere .
The rings ' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons .
As a whole , the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn , some of which are composed of very bright materialâ '' water ice .
However , there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system ; the Saturnian F ring and the Î ring are both narrow , relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons .
The newly discovered outer rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn .
Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus .
In addition , dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter .
In contrast , the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus , although it is less complex , darker and contains more dust ; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet .
A university is an institution where teaching and research is done .
The word university comes from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium , roughly meaning `` community of teachers and scholars . ''
People can attend university to get a degree .
Unlike the schooling they have done before , the courses at university are specialized .
A person studying biology at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields , like languages or history .
To get a higher degree , people must do some research .
The universities were born in Europe during the Middle Ages .
The first institution of this type was the University of Bologna that later became a model for similar centers of education .
This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought , although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages .
At first , the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages , they remained tied to the Catholic Church .
At the beginning , they had worked to teach the so-called `` seven liberal arts '' -LRB- the trivium and the quadrivium -RRB- :
That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields .
A university can include several campuses , or different places where classes are taught .
In each campus there are several faculties and university schools -LRB- mainly for teaching -RRB- , and also laboratories , departments and institutes of research .
Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries , study rooms , and gymnasiums for students that live there .
Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree .
The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector , who governs the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body .
There is a group of famous universities called the Ivy League .
They are :
VolapÃ 1\/4 k is a constructed language created in 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer .
Schleyer was a Catholic priest from Germany .
He felt that God had told him in a dream to make an international language .
VolapÃ 1\/4 k conventions took place in 1884 , 1887 , and 1889 .
The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other .
VolapÃ 1\/4 k became less popular after 1887 when Esperanto was published .
Part of the reason was that Esperanto is easier to learn with a simpler grammar .
There are only 25-30 VolapÃ 1\/4 k speakers in the world today .
The vocabulary of VolapÃ 1\/4 k is mostly English , with some words from German and French .
`` Vol '' and `` pÃ 1\/4 k '' come from the English words `` world '' and `` speech '' .
The grammar is based on Indo-European languagesEsperanto .

Vocabulary means a list of words .
Someone 's vocabulary is all the words that he or she knows .
A five year old would probably know about 5000 words .
An adult who has studied at university or college may know at least 20000 words in their language .
The vocabulary of a language is always changing .
New words are invented or words change their meaning .
This means that dictionaries have to be updated .
Words to do with computers such as `` download '' are new to the English language .
The new word `` bling '' came from hip hop .
Words like `` cool '' have developed new meanings .
If someone wanted to try to find out roughly how many words they knew , they could look at a page in a dictionary and count how many of those words they knew -LRB- counting things like â singâ , â sangâ , â sungâ , â singingâ as one word -RRB- .
If they multiplied that by how many pages there were in the dictionary they could estimate how many words they knew .
It is difficult to be exact .
Some words may be understood but not known well enough to be used .
Words that are used are part of a person 's â active vocabularyâ .
Words that are only understood and not used are called â passive vocabularyâ .
Sometimes it may not be easy to decide if a word is understood .
It may depend on the context , or the words around it .
Knowing the â contextâ the word is being used in may make it possible to guess what it means .
Without knowing what a chough is , the phrase â I saw a chough fly off from its nestâ would let someone guess that it is a kind of bird .
Someone who knows many words is said to have a wide vocabulary .
It is good to develop a wide vocabulary .
Knowing lots of words helps with reading , listening , writing , and talking to people .
The English language has a very large vocabulary .
This is because of Britainâ s history .
Every time Britain was invaded , the new people brought new words .
There are words from the Celts , Anglo Saxons , Vikings , Romans , and French .
There are also many words from Ancient Greek and Latin .
Many of these new words were used as well as the old ones but they may have a different meaning .
For example : `` pork '' came from the old French word porc -LRB- pig -RRB- , but it means food that comes from a pig .
